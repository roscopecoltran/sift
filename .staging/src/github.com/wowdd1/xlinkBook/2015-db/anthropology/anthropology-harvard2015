Anthropology1650 | Thinking with Collections | http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/4185 | instructors: David R. Odo term:Half course (spring term). Tu., 3–5. EXAM GROUP:   16 description:Anthropologists have to varying degrees been interested in the social nature of works of art and other material objects since the founding of the discipline, but especially in objects created outside of western societies, the traditional domain of art historians. In art history, recent years have witnessed a shift toward a more global scope of research and away from Eurocentric definitions of what constitutes art, even as anthropological interest in all forms of art and art making continues to expand. This seminar will examine broad issues in material anthropology using objects from across multiple Harvard collections, including the Harvard Art Museums, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Houghton Library, the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, and other collecting entities. Ample consideration will be given to the making of objects, in a variety of artistic, cultural, and historical contexts. Theoretically and historically informed object-based investigations will enable seminar participants to discover new ways of using Harvard collections as an intellectual resource, critically examine exhibitionary strategies, and gain an understanding of complex collecting practices and politics, all within a comparative, cross-institution framework. Students will produce original work based on primary research conducting in Harvard collections.

This course examines the Shari’a, primarily understood as law through an anthropological lens in recent and contemporary life. It will attend to the conjunctures, imaginaries and practices between ’ law’, culture and morality initially in the Muslim world before shifting to debates on incorporating Sharia law in the West.

About the only thing that has remained consistent about gangs is their characterization as the internal Other.

W., 3–5. EXAM GROUP:   6 description:This course interrogates the processes that underlie the act of eating and tasting food. We approach this question from the anthropology of science, the anthropology of the senses and political economy. We explore the ways we use our senses to taste food, and the intersection between sensual experiences and language. How do our senses interact with each other to constitute the taste experience and how do we verbalize it? How do individual sensorial experiences become part of broader social phenomena? A second strand of analysis will consider the relationship between food and systems of knowledge: how do we distinguish between safe and unsafe food and what is the difference between natural and industrial? The third strand of analysis will consider the question of how taste is formulated before it arrives to our plates. What are the conditions of production and circulation of food, and the connection between place and taste. We will read a variety of case studies with an emphasis on East Asia.

To address these questions we will explore urban lives and spaces across cities in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The course will include works in anthropology, geography, urban studies, and documentary film.

It asks what configurations of actors - states, corporations, citizens, NGOs, transnational bodies, para-states - are trying to manage social life in different domains, devoting particular attention to the role of scientists and scientific logics in informng debate and practice. Drawing on recent ethnographies, we investigate key technologies of governance (statistics, audit, documents, policy) in the administration of such fields as health/disease, environment, urban planning, public health, and security. The course is designed to help students currently developing PhD projects incorporate an interest in governance through science into their dissertation projects.
