ECON10a | Principles of Economics | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-10062/2014/fall | instructors:Siddiq M. Abdullah http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/siddiq-m-abdullah description: 
ECON1005 | Foundations of Real-World Economics | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14599/2014/fall | instructors:John Komlos http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/john-komlos description:The course discusses complex economic processes in relatively simple terms so that they can be understood without the use of mathematics. The focus is on real-world applications of economics rather than the academic mainstream's blackboard economics, which relies on theoretical reasoning and abstract models of the economy. We apply the concepts we learn to contemporary controversial topics such as minimum wage legislation, the function of unions, and why the free market overcharges for health care. We explore why the current economy is—using Paul Krugman's words—in a low-level depression and is drifting rudderless. Krugman has also referred to it as a sour economy because it is unable to provide a sweet life for so many millions of its citizens. Blackboard economists do not have the answers because they are unable to think creatively about new institutional structures to transition to a full-employment, high-well-being economy. In contrast, in this course we incorporate ideas from psychology, sociology, and political science into our discussions in order to explore these issues. We also discuss ways to restructure the economy in order to extricate ourselves from the mess left over by the bailouts of the big banks. The course includes concepts from both microeconomics and macroeconomics. (4 credits) 
ECON1010 | Microeconomic Theory | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-10782/2014/fall | instructors:Bruce D. Watson http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/bruce-d-watson description:This course presents the basic analytical tools of microeconomics. We start by looking at the decision making of individual consumers and ask how these decisions can be optimized or improved. Next, we look at the ways firms make and coordinate their decisions under varying market structures, including perfect competition and monopoly. Then we look at strategic behavior in imperfectly competitive markets, making use of concepts from game theory such as Nash equilibrium. Finally, we take up topics including bargaining theory, information economics, environmental externalities, and public goods. (4 credits) 
ECON1012 | Macroeconomic Theory | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14509/2014/fall | instructors:Siddiq M. Abdullah http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/siddiq-m-abdullah description:This course provides an analysis of the economy in aggregate. It examines competing theories of national income determination, growth, unemployment, inflation, business cycles (recession and depression), financial markets, and the global economy. Special attention is paid to policy issues, the evolving debate over the role of government in the modern United State economy, budget deficits, trade deficits, and the changing nature of work in America. (4 credits) 
ECON1016 | Topics in Labor Economics | http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/topics-labor-economics | instructors:Jane P. Katz http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/jane-p-katz description:This course introduces students to what economists know about a range of important labor market issues, including the following: What determines wages for various types of work? When is it worth it to invest in more education? Is there discrimination in labor markets? Why are incomes becoming more unequal? How do macroeconomic conditions (booms and busts) affect wages and unemployment? Should we raise the minimum wage? Should we require students to stay in high school to age 18? What are the legal protections available to workers in the US? What are the impacts of unions? Students are presented the facts and ideas that allow them to critically evaluate many important aspects of work and labor markets. (4 credits) 
ECON1034 | Consumer Behavior | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14576/2014/fall | instructors:Bhavya Mohan http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/bhavya-mohan description:Have you ever wondered why you're so reluctant to order the same entrée as your dining partner? Or why you'd brave a blizzard to attend a show you weren't really that excited about—just because you already paid for the tickets? This course is designed to introduce students to the evolving field of consumer behavior. We explore people's behavior across a number of domains—from the cognitive biases that have an impact on our daily decisions, to the ways in which we're influenced by our peers, to the nudges governments can enact to shape our behavior. This course draws from research in behavioral economics, social psychology, and academic marketing, and is intended to broadly survey the field of consumer behavior. (4 credits) 
ECON1040 | Strategy, Conflict, and Cooperation | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-21946/2015/spring | instructors:Robert Neugeboren http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/robert-neugeboren description:This course is an introduction to the strategic way of thinking and a primer on the mathematical theory of games. Students learn about game theory through a combination of analytical techniques and a series of in-class and take-home exercises. Applications are drawn from economics and other social sciences. Topics include the prisoner's dilemma and the arms race, the minimax theorem, Nash equilibrium, bargaining, subgame perfection, and the evolution of cooperation. (4 credits) 
ECON1317 | Hybrid: The Economics of Emerging Markets—Asia and Eastern Europe | http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/hybrid-economics-emerging-markets-asia-eastern-europe | instructors:Bruno S. Sergi http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/bruno-s-sergi description:This course examines the theory that underpins understanding of economic growth and development of emerging economies in the global context. Focusing on China, India, Russia, the post-Soviet region, and other Southeast Asian emerging countries, we examine the causal factors, potential, and limit of current macroeconomic circumstances and project possible economic developments in light of these countries' opportunities. That is, booming markets as income levels rise, massive potential for their local consumer markets, abundant low-cost labor, richness in natural resources, and being at the forefront of international trade and business. Approaches to developing high tech innovation-based economies and boosting structural reforms and trade policy, and the strategies available to international firms for successful investment and business operation in these emerging market economies are analyzed. Students independently research, write, and present studies of the strategies of various emerging economies and the nature of the rapid economic transformations these countries are currently undergoing. (4 credits) 
ECON1340 | World Economic History | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14565/2014/fall | instructors:James A. Robinson http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/james-robinson description:This course provides an overview of the main facts about world economic history since the Neolithic revolution 10,000 years ago. It also analyzes the main theories that have been proposed to explain these facts. Among the questions discussed are: why did the Neolithic revolution happen much earlier in some parts of the world than others? Why did some historical societies, like ancient Rome, which were initially very successful economically, subsequently decline? What caused the British industrial revolution? Why did the industrial revolution spread to some parts of the world and not others? What is the connection between political and economic change? Why did the United States become the world's most successful economy in the nineteenth century? Will China be the most successful economy in the future? Has Africa always been poor and will it stay poor? The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Economics 1340. (4 credits)

ECON1476 | Hybrid: International Corporate Governance—Economic Theory in Practice | http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/hybrid-international-corporate-governance-economic-theory-practice | instructors:Charles A. Moran http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/charles-moran description:This course examines corporate governance topics, including international models, that collectively are termed agency theory in modern finance, as applied to the corporation, with focus on the separation of ownership and control and related issues. The formal and informal contracts that bind together shareholders, bondholders, directors, managers, employees, suppliers, customers, and communities are explored. The collaborative efforts as well as the potential conflicts of interest of these various constituencies are analyzed in the context of a changing legislative and regulatory environment. This enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of how corporate objectives are determined and achieved in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and Japan. Selected cases and readings illustrate research findings and highlight key issues in international corporate governance. The issues raised by abuses and scandals are integrated into class discussions and group assignments. (4 credits) 
ECON1500 | The Economics of Financial Markets | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-23271/2015/winter | instructors:Mark Tomass http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/mark-tomass description:This course studies the money market, the bond market, the foreign exchange market, the stock market, and the derivative markets. It provides the analytical skills necessary to understand forces that determine prices of financial and real assets. It also develops a system of tools to show how interest rates, prices of bonds, international capital flows, and exchange rates are simultaneously determined. Finally, it demonstrates how firms use financial derivatives, such as futures, options, and swaps to hedge against risk. (4 credits) 
ECON1600 | Economics of Business | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-13399/2014/fall | instructors:Robert E. Wayland http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/robert-e-wayland description:This course introduces economic concepts that are fundamental to understanding many of the issues faced by business firms. These include the economic perspective on the nature, scale, and organization of the firm; the role of information and transactions costs in internal and external markets; principal-agent theory; contracting and the firm's relationships with customers and suppliers. (4 credits) 
ECON1620 | Organizations, Management Behavior, and Economics | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-24215/2015/spring | instructors:Charles A. Moran http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/charles-moran description:Economic theories of organizations and management are explored using selected cases and readings to illustrate research findings and highlight key issues, including international dimensions. The evolution of corporate structure is considered as a basis for development of a model for the future relationship of economics, organizations, and management behavior. This includes consideration of nontraditional organization and management models to address current and future effectiveness and efficiency of organizations. This course examines topics that can be collectively termed contracts and business organization. The problem of economic organization and the problem of social cost are considered along with efficient incentives (contracts and ownership), design and dynamics of organizations, motivation (contracts, information, and incentives), and employment incentives (contracts, compensation, and careers). (4 credits) 
ECON1661 | Environmental Economics | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-24298/2015/spring | instructors:Jennifer Clifford http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/jennifer-clifford description:This course surveys the most critical topics in environmental economics. Economics, the science of how scarce resources are allocated, is at the core of our most challenging environmental issues. In a world of increasing scarcity and competing demands, economic analysis can guide public policy to efficient use of resources. Market failures are at the root of many of our most serious environmental problems. Remedies include getting prices to reflect true costs, providing productive incentive structures, and explicitly valuing environmental amenities. Topics covered in this course include the economics of population growth, poverty and income distribution, market failures, economic valuation, economic incentive instruments, food and water resources, international agricultural markets, fisheries, and wildlife conservation. (4 credits) 
ECON1920 | Capital Markets and Investments | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14510/2014/fall | instructors:Shaikh A. Hamid http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/shaikh-hamid description:Students are exposed to the framework of modern portfolio theory and investment analysis with which one can critically evaluate alternatives relating to investing in financial securities and construct portfolios with desired risk/return characteristics. The course examines capital markets and fundamental quantitative models used in securities analysis and portfolio management. Focus is on capital markets and instruments, organization of securities markets and trading, modern portfolio theory, statistical concepts, asset pricing models, market efficiency, behavioral finance and technical analysis, valuation of bonds and managing bond portfolios, valuation of equities, active versus passive investing, the role of derivative securities in investing, international investing, and performance evaluation. Course activities include a team-based project that involves analyzing the economy, industries, and securities and constructing an investment portfolio that can meet the needs and preferences of a hypothetical investor. (4 credits) 
ECON1925 | Hybrid: Emerging Markets—Investment Theories and Practice | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14548/2014/fall | instructors:Peter Marber http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/peter-marber description:Globalization is no longer an academic theory; it is a reality that affects all of our lives. From the foods we eat to the goods we buy, the ubiquity of developing countries from Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and former Soviet Union—those frequently referred to as emerging markets—intensifies daily. Yet beyond the well-documented commercial and cultural impacts of globalization, there are strong but less visible trends towards greater global financial and investment integration. What makes emerging financial markets different from those in the US, Europe, or Japan? What are the benefits of adding these markets to a traditional investment portfolio? How do policies shape these markets? Why invest in certain countries versus others? Within a country, which asset class should we invest in? How do hedge funds approach these markets vs. traditional investors? How has the global credit crisis that began in 2007 altered the trajectories of developing and industrialized countries? From the practical perspective of a US institutional investor, this course is geared to help answer these questions. Students develop greater abilities to analyze global macro trends and country fundamentals, master portfolio construction concepts, and implement practical investment strategies.

ECON1941 | Derivatives and Risk Management: Analytics and Applications | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14547/2014/fall | instructors:C. Bülent Aybar http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/c-b-lent-aybar description:This is a course on the analytics of financial derivatives and risk management that also covers a range of topics in contemporary finance. Specifically, the course examines the pricing and use of financial derivatives, including options, forwards, futures, and swaps, as well as credit derivatives in risk management. The course focuses extensively on the analytical aspects of derivative products and the practical applications of risk management tools in various contexts. (4 credits) 
ECON1944 | History of Financial Crises 1637-2014 | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14336/2014/fall | instructors:John Komlos http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/john-komlos description:The goal of this course is to discuss the 376-year history of financial crisis ending with the great meltdown of 2008. We ascertain recurring historical patterns of financial bubbles without, however, overlooking critical differences. If history repeats itself, why can't we avoid making the same mistakes over and over again? The great meltdown happened at a time when most macroeconomists (including Nobel Prize winner Bob Lucas as well as none other than the current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke) were writing about the great moderation, that is, that business cycles have vanished for all practical purposes. They, along with most of their colleagues, were dead wrong. The historical evidence enables us to gain a more thorough understanding of the global economy in which we live and work. Our primary aim is not to concentrate on facts, theorems, or numbers but rather to see the big picture in an integrative and multi-disciplinary framework in a very long-run perspective. (4 credits)
