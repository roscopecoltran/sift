In these fields, signals are used to represent information about sound, images, sensors, and movement. By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia design, music composition and performance, responsive environments, video and sound installation, mobile applications, and beyond.  In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical point-of-view, developing tools that can be easily integrated into art-making using the graphical programming environment Max (a.k.a. Max/MSP/Jitter).  We will present a survey of Signal Processing techniques used in the sonic and visual arts, and will discuss the mathematical theories underlying these techniques.  Students will be encouraged to combine, modify, and extend working examples of software to create original digital artworks. Course development by Richard Stern and Tom Sullivan.

It solidifies the theoretical background and practical skills gained in 18320 and 18422.    The primary stress of the class will be on the IC design process as a whole. Such a process, seen as a sequence of design decisions, must lead to a design which optimizes a given objective function under a number of constraints. The optimum design must be achieved using a number of variables involving all levels of design abstraction and ranging between architecture choice and detail of the IC layout.     Typical design objectives adopted in class designs will be IC performance (throughput, power, signal-to-noise ratio, clock frequency, gain-bandwidth, etc.) and typical constraints will be die size and minimum feature size.    The second most important objective of the class is to mimic a large design team environment in which individual designers must: (a) communicate precisely and efficiently his/her ideas and (b) utilize any feedback provided by the "design environment." This objective will be achieved through class presentations given by each student and by stressing the importance of design documentation.

Being an inspired and innovative engineer is not really enough. To accomplish your goals as an engineer you have to understand how organizations work, and how to get all kinds of people to help you.  In other words, you need to be a leader in your organization, whether that is a start-up or a Fortune 100 company.  The class will begin by reviewing basic economics and financial accounting terms: a leader must know something about money.  There will be hands-on classes on the predominant American corporate culture: a leader must know the atmosphere he or she breathes.  The meat of the course will be learning about four keys to leadership: a working knowledge of variability in processes and people; some basic psychology, including personality types; some epistemology---how to really know what you think you know; and systems theory to understand all the parts of an enterprise.  Classroom demonstrations and ungraded homework will illustrate each of these four keys.    Each situation requiring leadership is unique, but studying the four keys will prepare you to step in and act with confidence.  When you finish this course you will be prepared to lead not just an engineering team, but to lead an enterprise.

ECE18797 | Machine Learning for Signal Processing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=18797&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Ramakrishnan, Bhiksha description:Signal Processing is the science that deals with extraction of information from signals of various kinds. This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.
