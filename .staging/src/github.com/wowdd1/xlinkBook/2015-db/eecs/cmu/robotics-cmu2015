Such systems include digital+physical toys and gadgets, kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments, interactive wearables, etc. This is a project-based course that deals with all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities. The class consists of students from different disciplines who collaboratively synthesize and implement several systems in a short period of time. The course is organized around a large set of essential skills that students must gain in order to effectively tackle physical computing problems. It is then deployed through a series of quick group projects that utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider HOW to make things, but also for WHOM we design, WHEN the time is ripe, and WHY the making is worthwhile/necessary.  Upon completion of this course the students will be able to:      work in a mixed physical-digital environment and laboratory     make effective use of standard hardware and software tools for physical computing     approach complex physical computing problems with a systematic overview that integrates iterative research and design steps     generate systems specifications from a perceived need     partition functionality between hardware and software     produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems     use computer-aided development tools for design, fabrication and testing and debugging     evaluate the system in the context of an end user application or experience

Game engines also handle artistic content, providing or integrating with authoring tools to ease the process of creating high-fidelity games.In this course, we will discuss the problems game engines attempt to solve, examine how current state-of-the-art engines address these problems, and create our own engines based on what we learn. We will cover both the content authoring and runtime aspects of engines. Coursework will consist of frequent, tightly-scoped programming and system design assignments; expeditions through game engine source code; and two group projects -- one in an engine created from scratch, and one that requires modification of an existing engine.Prerequisites: Students will be expected to be fluent in at least one programming language. We will be working with C++, Javascript, and a smattering of Python. We will be using git for version control and code sharing. The assignments in the course will be designed to be completed on an OSX or Linux workstation (e.g. the IDeATe "virtual cluster"). Working with Windows will be possible, but might require extra effort. We will be building a 3D model pipeline around Blender, but no prior knowledge of the tool will be assumed.

The higher the complexity of the system, the more its creators benefit from applying formal processes to its development-processes that are collectively known under the umbrella "systems engineering." Systems engineering is not a layer of management demanding reports from the technical wizards who conceive great products. It is a formal discipline that guides a product from conception and design all the way to production, marketing, servicing, and disposal. In this course we will study the fundamental elements of systems engineering as they apply to the development robotic systems. Topics will include: requirements analysis, use case analysis, functional analysis, design synthesis and validation, system simulation, system testing, safety and reliability, user studies, manufacturability, project management (including scheduling and costing), knowledge management, and logistics and supply chain. Many of these elements will be applied in the MRSD Project Course I and II, thus giving students an opportunity to put the theory in practice in a real product design activity. Please note that this course is for MRSD students only.

ROB16822 | Geometry-based Methods in Vision: Geometry-based Methods in Vision | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16822&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Hebert, Martial description:The course focuses on the geometric aspects of computer vision: The geometry of image formation and its use for 3D reconstruction and calibration. The objective of the course is to introduce the formal tools and results that are necessary for developing multi-view reconstruction algorithms. The fundamental tools introduced study affine and projective geometry, which are essential to the development of image formation models. Additional algebraic tools, such as exterior algebras are also introduced at the beginning of the course. These tools are then used to develop formal models of geometric image formation for a single view (camera model), two views (fundamental matrix), and three views (trifocal tensor); 3D reconstruction from multiple images; and auto-calibration.    Prerequisites: Computer Vision (16-721 or equivalent)    Books: The Geometry of Multiple Images. Faugeras and Long, MIT Press.

ROB16831 | Statistical Techniques in Robotics | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16831&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Bagnell, James description:Probabilistic and learning techniques are now an essential part of  building robots (or embedded systems) designed to operate in the real  world. These systems must deal with uncertainty and adapt to changes  in the environment by learning from experience. Uncertainty arises  from many sources: the inherent limitations in our ability to model  the world, noise and perceptual limitations in sensor measurements,  and the approximate nature of algorithmic solutions. Building  intelligent machines also requires that they adapt to their  environment. Few things are more frustrating than machines that  repeat the same mistake over and over again. We'll explore modern  learning techniques that are effective at learning online: i.e.  throughout the robots operation. We'll explore how the twin ideas of  uncertainty and adaptation are closely tied in both theory and  implementation.

Moving forward, we will discuss additional requirements that arise from performing manipulation tasks collaboratively with people: moving from functional to optimal motion, learning from demonstration, and coordination via understanding and expressing intent.
ROB16850 | Systems Engineering | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16850&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Wettergreen, David description:Systems Engineering is a multidisciplinary approach and means of creating complex devices and systems. It recognizes that hardware and software and the operating environment are interrelated in the process of creating complex systems. How do we trade off hardware "apples" and software "oranges"? What methods and tools can we apply to help make wise decisions? To create effective systems we must recognize and consider many perspectives, issues, and disciplines simultaneously.  In this course our focus is on systems of hardware and software components engineered to perform complex behavior. Such systems embed computing elements, integrate sensors and actuators, operate in a reliable and timely fashion, and demand rigorous engineering from conception through production. Applications of robotics technology will be used to illustrate applications and the challenges in engineering complex systems.  Concepts, problems, and methods of systems engineering are introduced and discussed in lectures and developed in assignments. Case studies and guest lectures present best practice in the field. Readings from current literature will tie theory to practical methods of creating complex devices.  Students gain practical experience through a highly-structured small group project that will run the entire semester.  We will progress through systems engineering processes of analysis, design, implementation, and deployment with parallel consideration of testing and evaluation. Past projects have used the Pittsburgh Children's Museum as context where we have collaborated to create and deploy interactive exhibits within the museum.  This course should be appropriate for graduate students in engineering, sciences and design and for advanced undergraduates with the permission of the instructor. Class size will be limited.
