(PI) description:Computers have come to permeate many aspects of our lives, from how we communicate with each other to how we produce and consume information. And while it is all too easy to think of computing in terms of the products and applications we see emerging from technology companies, the intellectual foundations of computer science go much deeper.  Indeed, beneath the surface of the tools we use, the social networks we engage in, and the web of information we search, lays a field rich with fascinating, intellectually exciting, and sometimes unexpectedly surprising ideas.nnIn this seminar, we will explore several of the great ideas in computer science, looking at both challenging problems and their impact on real applications.  From understanding how search engines on the Web work to looking at mathematical theories underlying social networks, from questioning whether a computer can be intelligent to analyzing the notion of what is even possible to compute, this seminar will take us on a series of intellectual excursions that will change the way you look at computers.nnNo prior experience with computer science or programming is required, but a high school mathematics background, an interest in problem-solving, and a healthy curiosity will go a long way toward ensuring an enjoyable and enlightening experience.  Students will work in small groups to research topics in computer science they find most intriguing.

In this course we give an introduction to some of these frameworks, including utility theory, decision analysis, game theory, and Markov decision processes.  We also discuss why people sometimes make seemingly reasonable, yet irrational, decisions.  We begin the class by presenting some of the basics of probability theory, which serves as the main mathematical foundation for the decision making frameworks we will subsequently present.  Although we provide a mathematical/computational basis for the decision making frameworks we examine, we also seek to give intuitive (and sometime counterintuitive) explanations for actual decision making behavior through in-class demonstrations.  No prior experience with probability theory is needed (we'll cover what you need to know in class), but students should be comfortable with mathematical manipulation at the level of Math 20 or Math 41.

CS44N | Computational Thinking and Systems in the Real-World | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=CS44N | instructors:Cheriton, D. (PI) description:Computing in the real-world is too often viewed as working away concocting some computer incantations hidden inside some high technology company.  However, computing and computer communication has infiltrated and in many cases revolutionized several ¿systems¿ in the real world, including financial systems, inventory management, advertising systems, supply chain management, transportation systems, defense systems and so on.  Moreover, the discipline of thinking that has developed to build these systems, computational thinking, has powerful applicability to real-world problems and situations outside of computer programming.  This course provides an introduction and exposure to some of these dramatic trends, opportunities and risks.  Also included is an introduction to some basic ideas in ¿computational thinking¿.  The course will include guest speakers.  No programming competence is assumed but exposure to programming would be useful.  Interest in the real world and interest is not being run-over by this trend is essential.
CS45N | Computers and Photography: From Capture to Sharing | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=CS45N | instructors:Garcia-Molina, H. (PI) description:Preference to freshmen with experience in photography and use of computers. Elements of photography, such as lighting, focus, depth of field, aperture, and composition.

Digital SLRs and editing software will be provided to those students who do not wish to use their own.
CS46N | Big Data, Big Discoveries, Big Fallacies | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=CS46N | instructors:Widom, J. (PI) description:A sea change has occurred in science, technology, medicine, politics, and society as a whole: many of the world's biggest discoveries and decisions are now being made on the basis of analyzing massive data sets, referred to as "big data". Everyday examples include social-network friend recommendations, and weather predictions far more accurate than a decade ago; both use vast collections of data to model the past and predict the future. But it is surprisingly easy to come to false conclusions from data analysis alone. For example, we might conclude that acne medicine prevents heart attacks and strokes, if we forget to factor in the age of the patients. Privacy is a major concern: Target stores analyzed buying patterns to predict with remarkable accuracy which of their shoppers had just become pregnant, but trouble arose when they sent baby ads to the homes of pregnant teens whose parents weren't yet in the know. We will start by surveying the history of data-driven activities, leading up to the recent Big Data explosion. A variety of data analysis techniques will be covered, leading students to appreciate that even simple techniques can go a long way when the data set is large enough. Common stumbling blocks leading to false conclusions will be discussed, and students will be asked to debate the many issues surrounding privacy. In one project, students will see whose analysis techniques can best predict user movie ratings based on past rating behavior. A second project will be individually designed in an area of the student's choosing. The seminar will include a mix of assigned readings, small-scale investigations and assignments, classroom discussions, and two projects. No computer programming or special math skills are required; students will learn the basic techniques and tools they need to complete the data analysis assignments and projects.
