A whitepaper was prepared, and in 2005 the Initiative was selected to go forward. The IICâ€™s offices opened in spring 2006, and its first projects were selected that summer. Several of those projects continue at Harvard and at Massachusetts General Hospital as sponsored research. During its final year, 2009-10, the IIC's seminars and a subset of the projects were adopted by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
