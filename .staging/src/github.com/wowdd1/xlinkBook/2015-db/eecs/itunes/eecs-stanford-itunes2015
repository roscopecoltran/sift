384232917 | Programming Abstractions | https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/programming-abstractions/id384232917?mt=2&uo=4 | instructors:Julie Zelenski  ratings:50 description:This course is the natural successor to Programming Methodology and covers such advanced programming topics as recursion, algorithmic analysis, and data abstraction using the C++ programming language, which is similar to both C and Java. If you've taken the Computer Science AP exam and done well (scored 4 or 5) or earned a good grade in a college course, Programming Abstractions may be an appropriate course for you to start with, but often Programming Abstractions (Accelerated) is a better choice. Programming Abstractions assumes that you already have familiarity with good programming style and software engineering issues (at the level of Programming Methodology), and that you can use this understanding as a foundation on which to tackle new topics in programming and data abstraction. Topics: Abstraction and its relation to programming. Software engineering principles of data abstraction and modularity. Object-oriented programming, fundamental data structures (such as stacks, queues, sets) and data-directed design. Recursion and recursive data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs). Introduction to time and space complexity analysis. Uses the programming language C++ covering its basic facilities.
384233322 | Programming Massively Parallel Processors with CUDA | https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/programming-massively-parallel/id384233322?mt=2&uo=4 | instructors:Stanford University  ratings:32 description:Virtually all semiconductor market domains, including PCs, game consoles, mobile handsets, servers, supercomputers, and networks, are converging to concurrent platforms. There are two important reasons for this trend. First, these concurrent processors can potentially offer more effective use of chip space and power than traditional monolithic microprocessors for many demanding applications. Second, an increasing number of applications that traditionally used Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are now implemented with concurrent processors in order to improve functionality and reduce engineering cost. The real challenge is to develop applications software that effectively uses these concurrent processors to achieve efficiency and performance goals.The aim of this course is to provide students with knowledge and hands-on experience in developing applications software for processors with massively parallel computing resources. In general, we refer to a processor as massively parallel if it has the ability to complete more than 64 arithmetic operations per clock cycle. Many commercial offerings from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel already offer such levels of concurrency. Effectively programming these processors will require in-depth knowledge about parallel programming principles, as well as the parallelism models, communication models, and resource limitations of these processors. The target audiences of the course are students who want to develop exciting applications for these processors, as well as those who want to develop programming tools and future implementations for these processors.Visit the CS193G companion website for course materials.

Ten members deep, Odd Future has been compared to Wu-Tang Clan, but its style is far less thugged-out and way more bugged-out. Led by Tyler, the Creator, the group is all about shattering preconceived notions of traditional hip-hop; its tracks are all over the place stylistically. On Vol. 2, Odd Future effortlessly shifts between straight-up R&B ("White"), hyperactive Dirty South parody ("We Got B*tches," "50"), experimental electro sputtering ("Rella"), and a righteously grimy, throwback posse cut ("Oldie," featuring the return of fan favorite Earl Sweatshirt). Lyrically, the members have toned down the omnipresent illicit talk of their earlier work, but they remain focused on references to pop culture, current events, and Wolf Gang pride. Check out "Sam (Is Dead)," "Real B*tch," and "NY (Ned Flanders)."
