Realists, in contrast, argue that war is simply a fact of life and not a proper subject for moral judgment, any more than we would judge an attack by a pack of wolves in moral terms. In between is just war theory, which claims that some wars, but not all, are morally justified. We will explore these theories, and will consider how just war theory comports with international law rules governing recourse to force. We will also explore justice in war, that is, the moral and legal rules governing the conduct of war, such as the requirement to avoid targeting non-combatants. Finally, we will consider how war should be terminated; what should be the nature of justified peace? We will critically evaluate the application of just war theory in the context of contemporary security problems, including: (1) transnational conflicts between states and nonstate groups and the so-called "war on terrorism"; (2) civil wars; (3) demands for military intervention to halt humanitarian atrocities taking place in another state. Same as LAW 751.

(PI); Covington, J. (GP) description:Mini-Course taught by Rega Wood in association with Santiago Melo Arias & Professors Alan Code & Calvin Normore.  Code, Wood, & Melo Arias have spent the last 6 months intensively studying Richard Rufus of Cornwall's commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics Zeta, Eta, & Theta. This June we will present Rufus' views on ontology, unity, & universals.  There will be 6 two hour sessions on June, 4,5, & 6 (Thurs - Saturday), 10-12 noon , 2-4 pm.  Readings will be taken chiefly from Melo Arias' new translations of Rufus' circa 1238 commentary; other readings, from Aristotle and Averroes.  We will consider the difference between the treatment of definition, essence and being in logic and in metaphysics, the sense in which accidents have definitions, the unity of genus and differentia in the ndefinitions of substances, the unity of form and proximate matter in hylomorphic compounds, and the unity of the parts of the rational soul.  In this context we will discuss the formal distinction pioneered by Rufus as a description of differences in formal predication consistent with real sameness.Richard Rufus was the nfirst Western professor to lecture on Aristotle's metaphysics in Medieval Europe.

PHIL23D | Principia as Paradigm: Mechanics After Newton | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHIL23D | instructors:King, D. (PI) description:Newton's Principia is widely and rightly acknowledged as a landmark achievement in physics that has had a profound impact on the subsequent development of science. This tutorial will focus on what sorts of influence the Principia had on the development of mechanics in roughly the first century following its publication. The work of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace will serve as the primary examples of this development. Kuhn's description of paradigms in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions provides a starting point for understanding some of these forms of influence. In particular, this tutorial will try to explore two central areas of influence. The first is Newton's conceptual framework and how it was modified in the further development of mechanics during this period. The second is how projects suggested by residual problems within the Principia shaped ongoing study.
PHIL23U | Death and What Comes After | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHIL23U | instructors:Duffy, H. (PI) description:Is it irrational to fear death? Is death bad for you? Does it make sense to want to be immortal? How does what happens after our deaths matter to us?nAncient and contemporary philosophers give surprising answers to these questions about death, answers that shed light on basic questions about what matters in life. Among those we'll read are Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Bernard Williams, Thomas Nagel and Samuel Scheffler.

What is the relation between theory and practice in politics?n nThis course will focus on the political philosophy of the Republic, Plato's most well known dialogue and a foundational text in the history of political thought. We will also consider how Plato's psychology underlies his political philosophy and how the political philosophy of the Republic is related to political thinking in Plato's later works. Emphasis will be on primary texts, although the instructor will recommend relevant secondary sources as needed. Students will work closely with the instructor to tailor a final assignment that engages with the text and furthers the student's educational goals and interests.

We will examine the question of whether, and to what extent, concepts, beliefs, and desires can influence the content of perception. If these cognitive states can influence the content of perceptual states, how worried should we be about the ability of perception to justify belief, both in everyday life and in scientific inquiry?
PHIL23Y | Knowledge in Action: Anscombe's Intention | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHIL23Y | instructors:Hauthaler, N. (PI) description:Anscombe's Intention is one of the foundational texts of 20th century analytic philosophy. It brings together central issues from the philosophy of mind, epistemology, philosophy of language -- and lays the ground for contemporary philosophy of action. Anscombe raises (and answers) questions regarding the nature of intentional action, intention, reasons for action, agential self-knowledge, and practical reasoning, connecting them all in one unified account. nIn the tutorial we will discuss these issues through a close reading of Intention. A short, terse, and marvelously rich self-contained piece of philosophical investigation, it is particularly well-suited for this purpose. Our work with the text should yield a solid basis notably in the philosophy of action, which will be useful for various other courses and areas (in philosophy of action, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language, and ethics). Methodologically the tutorial will foster philosophical skills regarding the analysis, interpretation, and criticism of a dense and rich philosophical text such as Anscombe's.

We will address questions like the following: What, if anything, is distinctive about art and aesthetic experience?, What is aesthetic value, and how do aesthetic values relate to and interact with values of other kinds?, What is fiction and why are people interested in it?, In what ways are works of art expressive of feelings or emotions? What similarities and differences are there in the expressive qualities of music, literature, painting, poetry? How might we learn from works of art of one or another kind, and how might they work to change people's perspectives or attitudes?, In what ways do works of art serve as vehicles of communication? Is there a fundamental difference between the value of works of art, and that of beautiful natural objects? (These various issues are related, as we shall see; we'll be exploring several of them simultaneously.)

(PI) description:Socrates is a key figure in the history of western philosophy. He is credited for inventing moral philosophy and for revolutionizing the way we think about and do philosophy. Moreover, his historical influence is often compared to that of Jesus and Buddha, partly because his life's mission was to benefit others, but also because his life and cause remain mysterious.nInterest in Socrates tends to divide along these exact lines: some (like Xenophon) are more interested in the man, his life and his impact on his friends and fellow citizens; others (like Aristotle) are more interested in his contribution to philosophy, his views, arguments and methods. nIn this course, we will try to learn more about both parts of Socrates' career by examining the relation between them. We will start by focusing on what is characteristic of his life: What did he do? And why did he do the things he did? In particular, how did he become a philosopher and how did he develop his distinctive approach to philosophy, his own philosophical voice?

(PI) description:Economic analysis inevitably raises moral questions. Getting clear on those moral questions, and the competing answers to them, can help improve both economic analysis and our understanding of the values involved in alternative social policies.  This course focuses on a central economic institution: the market.  How have the benefits and costs of using markets been understood?  For example, it is often claimed that markets are good for welfare, but how is welfare to be understood?  What is the connection between markets and different values such as equality and autonomy?  What, if anything is wrong with markets in everything? Are there moral considerations that allow us to, distinguish different markets? This course examines competing answers to these questions, drawing on historical and contemporary literature.  Readings include Adam Smith, JS Mill, Karl Marx, Michael Walzer, Dan Hausman and Michael McPherson and Debra Satz among others. For graduate students only.

PHIL50S | Truth, Proof and Probability: An Introduction To Philosophical and Logical Reasoning | http://PHIL50S.stanford.edu | instructors:Hawke, P. (PI); Duffy, H. (TA) description:Under what conditions does a set of true claims guarantee or make probable a particular conclusion? In this course we study rigorous tools and techniques supporting good reasoning, covering topics of particular significance to modern philosophy and logic. Contemporary philosophy continues a traditional focus on foundational problems related to value, inquiry, mind and reality, but with modern subject matter (often engaging natural, social and mathematical science) and rigorous methods, including set theory, probability theory and formal logic. This course introduces such methods, with a focus on core conceptual distinctions, motivations and debates, and basic practical skills. The presentation will be rigorous, but overly technical topics are avoided. Topics: propositional logic; valid argument forms; truth tables; Russell¿s paradox; infinite sets; kinds of truth; possibility and necessity; basic probability theory; subjective versus objective probability; Bayes¿ rule; correlation and causation. No previous philosophical or mathematical training pre-supposed. Appreciation of precise thinking an advantage. Useful preparation for relevant topics in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, economics and statistics.

PHIL72 | Contemporary Moral Problems (ETHICSOC 185M, POLISCI 134P) | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHIL72 | instructors:Berkey, B. (PI) description:This course addresses moral issues that play a major role in contemporary public discourse. The course aims to encourage students to consider moral problems in a reflective, systematic manner, and to equip students with skills that will enable them to do so. Questions to be addressed include: Do rich countries have an obligation to accept refugees from other parts of the world? Do such obligations conflict with the right of individuals to protect their culture? Is there anything principally wrong in the use of drones for purposes of warfare? Do we have obligations to the environment, and if so why? What is racism and what makes it wrong? And what are feminist ideals?
PHIL73 | Collective Action Problems: Ethics, Politics, & Culture (ETHICSOC 180M, POLISCI 131A, PUBLPOL 304A) | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHIL73 | instructors:Herzog, L. (PI); Reyes, A. (GP) description:When acting on one's own, it is often easy to know what the morally right action is. But many moral problems arise from the fact that many individuals act together leading to dilemmas, in which what is individually rational is collectively irrational. For example, the collective result of our consumption decisions is to warm the planet. But individual decisions seem to have no effect on climate change. Such collective action situations give rise to moral questions: Are individuals required to take their contributions  to wider systemic effects into account? Does it make a difference whether or not others are doing their share, for example with regard to fighting global poverty? In many cases, the best solution for collective action problems are institutions. But when these are deficient or non-existing, what should individuals do? Do they have a duty to assist in building institutions, and what would this duty imply in practical terms? Interdisciplinary perspective, reading authors from philosophy, politics, economics and sociology such as Elinor Ostrom, Peter Singer or Liam Murphy, relating to current questions such as global poverty and climate change. No background assumed; no mathematical work required.
PHIL74A | Ethics in a Human Life (HUMBIO 74) | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHIL74A | instructors:Dannenberg, J. (PI) description:Ethical questions pervade a human life from before a person is conceived until after she dies, and at every point in between. This course raises a series of ethical questions, following along the path of a person¿s life ¿ questions that arise before, during, and after she lives it.  We will explore distinctive questions that a life presents at each of several familiar stages: prior to birth, childhood, adulthood, death, and even beyond.  We will consider how some philosophers have tried to answer these questions, and we will think about how answering them might help us form a better understanding of the ethical shape of a human life as a whole.  Seminar for Juniors and Seniors in Philosophy or Humbio - others by permission.
PHIL75S | Liberty and Equality | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHIL75S | instructors: description:This course concerns recent attempts by social contract theorists to reconcile liberty and equality.

Cohen, possibly Mills and Okin or Pateman.  I again would structure each session around a question, such as: Is there a conflict between equality and liberty? What is liberty? Equality. Equality of opportunity? Or equality of condition?  What tools do these social contract theorists offer for criticizing racial or gender inequality?
