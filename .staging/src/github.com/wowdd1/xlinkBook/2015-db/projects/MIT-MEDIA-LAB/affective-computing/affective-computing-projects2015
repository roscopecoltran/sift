We are conducting experiments to measure EEG dynamics and physical movements performed by participants who are using software designed to invite physical and musical expression of the basic emotions. The present demonstration of this system incorporates an expressive gesture sonification system using a Leap Motion device, paired with an ambient music engine controlled by EEG-based affective indices. Our intention is to better understand affective engagement, by creating both a new musical interface to invite it, and a method to measure and monitor it. We are exploring the use of this device and protocol in therapeutic settings in which mood recognition and regulation is a primary goal.

Picard, Matthew Goodwin and Rob Morris Persons on the autism spectrum often report hypersensitivity to sound. Efforts have been made to manage this condition, but there is wide room for improvement. One approach—exposure therapy—has promise, and a recent study showed that it helped several individuals diagnosed with autism overcome their sound sensitivities. In this project, we borrow principles from exposure therapy, and use fun, engaging games to help individuals gradually get used to sounds that they might ordinarily find frightening or painful. view site

Picard, Robert Randall Morris and Javier Hernandez Rivera Technologies to automatically recognize stress are extremely important to prevent chronic psychological stress and pathophysiological risks associated with it. The introduction of comfortable and wearable biosensors has created new opportunities to measure stress in real-life environments, but there is often great variability in how people experience stress and how they express it physiologically. In this project, we modify the loss function of Support Vector Machines to encode a person's tendency to feel more or less stressed, and give more importance to the training samples of the most similar subjects. These changes are validated in a case study where skin conductance was monitored in nine call center employees during one week of their regular work. Employees working in this type of setting usually handle high volumes of calls every day, and they frequently interact with angry and frustrated customers that lead to high stress levels. view site
mit-media-affective-computing-4 | Autonomic Nervous System Activity in Epilepsy | http://affect.media.mit.edu/projectpages/epilepsy/index.html | description:Rosalind W. Picard and Ming-Zher Poh We are performing long-term measurements of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity on patients with epilepsy. In certain cases, autonomic symptoms are known to precede seizures. Usually in our data, the autonomic changes start when the seizure shows in the EEG, and can be measured with a wristband (much easier to wear every day than wearing an EEG). We found that the larger the signal we measure on the wrist, the longer the duration of cortical brain-wave suppression following the seizure. The duration of the latter is a strong candidate for a biomarker for SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy), and we are working with scientists and doctors to better understand this. In addition, bilateral changes in ANS activity may provide valuable information regarding seizure focus localization and semiology. view site

We measured participants' skin conductance as they learned to play with these new toys. By marking the stressful moments we were able to see what moments in learning should be redesigned. Our findings suggest that framing is key: how can we help children recognize their achievements? We also saw how children are excited to take on new responsibilities but are then quickly discouraged when they aren't given the resources to succeed. Our hope for this work is that by using skin conductance sensors, we can help companies better understand the unique perspective of children and build experiences fit for them. view site

Recent studies have shown that healthy and unhealthy sleep behaviors can be transmitted by social interactions between individuals within social networks. We investigate how social connectivity and light exposure influence sleep patterns, health, and outcomes such as mood, stress, and academic performance. Using multimodal data collected from closely connected MIT/Harvard undergraduates with wearable sensors and mobile phones, we are developing statistical and multiscale mathematical models of sleep dynamics within social networks based on sleep and circadian physiology. These models will provide insights into the emergent dynamics of sleep behaviors within social networks, and allow us to test the effects of candidate strategies for intervening in populations with unhealthy sleep behaviors.

Picard and Elliott Hedman What do customers really think about your company or brand? Using skin conductance sensors, we measure what excites and frustrates customers when discussing topics relevant to your brand. For example, with the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy, we saw conversations about empowerment and abortion upset conservative families. However, talking about the importance of strong families excited and engaged them. Rather than rely on self-reports, physiological measurements allow us to pinpoint what words and concepts affect your customers. We hope work like this will help companies better reflect on how their actions and messaging affect their customer's opinion in more detailed and accurate ways.

Picard and Elliott Hedman You can test whether a website is usable by making wire frames, but how do you know if that site, product, or store is emotionally engaging? We build quick, iterative environments where emotions can be tested and improved. Emphasis is on setting up the right motivation (users always have to buy what they pick), pressures (can you buy the laptop in 10 minutes?), and environment (competitors’ products better be on the shelf too). Once we see where customers are stressed or miss the fun part, we change the space on a daily, iterative cycle. Within two to three weeks, we can tell how to structure a new offering for a great experience. Seldom do the emotions we hope to create happen on the first try; emotion prototyping delivers the experience we want. We hope to better understand the benefits of emotion prototyping, especially while using the skin conductance sensor. view site

This creates a new challenge: in order to interpret the collected longitudinal data, we require the matching contextual information as well. Collecting weeks, months, and years of continuous biophysiological data makes it unfeasible to rely solely on our memory for providing the contextual information. Many view maintaining journals as burdensome, which may result in low compliance levels and unusable data. We present an architecture and implementation of a system for the acquisition, processing, and visualization of biophysiological signals and contextual information.

Picard and Elliott Hedman Physiological arousal is an important part of occupational therapy for children with autism and ADHD, but therapists do not have a way to objectively measure how therapy affects arousal. We hypothesize that when children participate in guided activities within an occupational therapy setting, informative changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) can be detected using iCalm. iCalm is a small, wireless sensor that measures EDA and motion, worn on the wrist or above the ankle. Statistical analysis describing how equipment affects EDA was inconclusive, suggesting that many factors play a role in how a child’s EDA changes. Case studies provided examples of how occupational therapy affected children’s EDA. This is the first study of the effects of occupational therapy’s in situ activities using continuous physiologic measures. The results suggest that careful case study analyses of the relation between therapeutic activities and physiological arousal may inform clinical practice. view site

Picard, Szymon Fedor, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Current methods to assess depression and then ultimately select appropriate treatment have many limitations. They are usually based on having a clinician rate scales, which were developed in the 1960s. Their main drawbacks are lack of objectivity, being symptom-based and not preventative, and requiring accurate communication. This work explores new technology to assess depression, including its increase or decrease, in an automatic, more objective, pre-symptomatic, and cost-effective way using wearable sensors and smart phones for 24/7 monitoring of different personal parameters such as physiological data, voice characteristics, sleep, social interaction. We aim to enable early diagnosis of depression, prevention of depression, assessment of depression for people who cannot communicate, better assignment of a treatment, early detection of treatment remission and response, and anticipation of post-treatment relapse or recovery.

Picard, Szymon Fedor, Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital Depression correlated with anxiety is one of the key factors leading to suicidal behavior, and is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite the scope and seriousness of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, we know surprisingly little about what suicidal thoughts look like in nature (e.g., How frequent, intense, and persistent are they among those who have them? What cognitive, affective/physiological, behavioral, and social factors trigger their occurrence?). The reason for this lack of information is that historically researchers have used retrospective self-report to measure suicidal thoughts, and have lacked the tools to measure them as they naturally occur. In this work we explore use of wearable devices and smartphones to identify behavioral, affective, and physiological predictors of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
