mit-media-design-fiction-1 | (Im)possible Baby | http://aihasegawa.info/?works=impossible-baby | description:Ai Hasegawa, Sputniko! and Asako Makimura Delivering a baby from same-sex parents is not a sci-fi dream anymore–recent developments in genetics and stem cell research have made this dream much closer to reality. Is creating a baby from same-sex parents the right thing to do? Who has the right to decide this, and how? This project explores the bioethics of producing babies for same-sex couples. In the first phase, DNA data will be simulated to visualize the "potential baby." The project will then explore creating partial organs of the "potential baby" over the next few years. You have the right to know, think, and raise your voice about whether this dream becomes a reality–not just the authorities and researchers. view site
mit-media-design-fiction-2 | CremateBot: Transform, Reborn, Free | http://www.pixedge.com/crematebot | description:Sputniko! and Dan Chen CremateBot is an apparatus that takes in human-body samples—such as fingernails, hair, or dead skin—and turns them into ashes through the cremation process. The process of converting human remains to ashes becomes a critical experience for observers, causing witnesses to question their sense of existence and physical self through the conversion process. CremateBot transforms our physical self and celebrates our rebirth through self-regeneration. The transformation and rebirth open our imagination to go beyond our physical self and cross the span of time. Similar to Theseus' paradox, the dead human cells—which at one point were considered part of our physical selves and helped to define our sense of existence—are continually replaced with newly generated cells. With recent advancements in implants, biomechatronics, and bioengineered organs, how we define ourselves is increasingly blurred. view site
mit-media-design-fiction-3 | Crowbot Jenny | http://sputniko.com/2011/08/crowbot-jenny-2011/ | description:Sputniko! (Hiromi Ozaki) Crowbot Jenny, inspired by Donna Haraway’s philosophical memoir When Species Meet (2007), is a solitary girl who, despite her generation’s tendency toward communication overload, has trouble relating to her peers. In fact, Crowbot Jenny prefers to talk with animals and develops the Crowbot, an instrument that replicates a range of crow calls, to commune with her army of birds. Sputniko! talked with various crow specialists from University of Cambridge (UK), University of Utsunomiya (Japan), and University of Tokyo (Japan) who also provided her with sample crow calls—such as "Hello," "I'm in danger," "I love you!" or "Where is my Child!?"—which she installed inside Crowbot. view site
mit-media-design-fiction-4 | Menstruation Machine—Takashi's Take | http://sputniko.com/2011/08/menstruation-machine-takashis-take-2010/ | description:Sputniko! (Hiromi Ozaki) What does menstruation mean, biologically, culturally, and historically, to humans? Who might choose to have it, and how might they have it? The Menstruation Machine—fitted with a blood dispensing mechanism and electrodes simulating the lower abdomen—simulates the pain and bleeding of a five-day menstruation process. The project video features a transvestite male, Takashi, who one day chooses to wear "Menstruation" in an attempt to biologically dress up as a female, being unsatisfied by just aesthetically appearing female. He builds and wears the machine to fulfill his desire to understand what the period feels like for his female friends. view site
mit-media-design-fiction-5 | Nostalgic Touch | http://www.pixedge.com/nostalgic_touch | description:Sputniko! and Dan Chen Nostalgic Touch proposes a new ritual for remembering the deceased in the digital and multicultural age. It is an apparatus that captures hand motions and attempts to replicate the sensation of intimacy or affection by playing back the comforting gestures. It stores gesture data of the people who you cared for, then plays them back after they are gone. Similar to rituals in all religions, it gives us a sense of comfort to deal with the death. People in Japan, Singapore, and China live with high standards of technology but many embrace religious rituals and superstitions as an important part of their wellbeing and decision-making. Nostalgic Touch explores how emerging technologies could be used to enrich the experience of these rituals. How could we augment these rituals to give an even better sense of comfort and intimacy? view site
mit-media-design-fiction-6 | Pop Roach | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=mit-media-design-fiction-6 Pop Roach | description:Ai Hasegawa and Sputniko! Facing issues of food crisis by overpopulation, this project explores a possible future where a small community of activists arises to design an "edible" cockroach that can survive in harsh environments. These genetically modified roaches are designed to pass their genes to the next generations; thus the awful black and brown roaches will be pushed to extinction by the newly designed, cute, colorful, tasty, and highly nutritional "pop roach." The color of these "pop roaches" corresponds to a different flavor, nutrition, and function, while the original ones remain black or brown, and not recommended to be eaten. How will genetic engineering shift our perception of food and eating habits? "Pop Roach" explores how we can expand our perception of cuisine to solve some of the world's most pressing problems.

The pavilion will include a permanent exhibition space by Sputniko! / Design Fiction group, and will host open workshops and lectures in the lab space for young children to experiment, discuss, and imagine the implications of emerging biotechnologies. The project is commissioned for Setouchi Art Triennale Festival in 2016.
mit-media-design-fiction-8 | Tranceflora - Amy's Glowing Silk | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=mit-media-design-fiction-8 Tranceflora - Amy's Glowing Silk | description:Sputniko! Biotechnology is changing nature, and with it, beauty. How will we and society as a whole respond to these changes? Aphrodite, the ancient Greek goddess of love, beauty, and procreation, is said to have been born from the ocean and wrapped in the smell of roses, and captivated the gods of Olympus with her beauty. Our heroine Amy turns herself into a modern biotech Aphrodite when she creates an irresistible rose-scented dress from genetically engineered silk to captivate her secret crush's heart. Her story is not entirely science fiction: we have created Amy's Dress using glowing silk, created in 2008 by the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) in Japan by incorporating jellyfish and coral genes into silkworms. We are also working with NIAS to develop a rose-scented rose silk and a "love-inducing" silk containing oxytocin, both engineered by Amy in the story.

This project proposes a possible future where people could choose to create a baby without a partner, solely on their own, by exploring the implications of recent research advancements such as the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS Cells).
