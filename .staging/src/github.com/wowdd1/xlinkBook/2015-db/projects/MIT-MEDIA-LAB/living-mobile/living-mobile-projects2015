mit-media-living-mobile-1 | Activ8 | http://speech.media.mit.edu/projects | description:Misha Sra and Chris Schmandt Activ8 is a system of three short games: See-Saw, a balancing game for Glass; Jump Beat, a music beat matching game for Glass; and Learning to Fly, a Kinect game where users keep a virtual bird in the air by flapping their arms. Recent epidemiological evidence points at sitting as being the most common contributor to an inactive lifestyle. We aim to offer a starting point towards designing and building an understanding about how "physical casual games" can contribute to helping address the perils of sitting. view site

JogCall is a cooperative and aesthetic system that persuades the couple to jog together, which is not only good for their physical exercise, but also for their emotional health. The system consists of i) a series of sensors deployed in the home, which sense the position of the partner getting ready for the morning jog, and cause pleasing alarms to wake up the snoozing partner, and ii) a wooden bird nest containing two movable 3D printed birds, which move closer together as the couple progresses.
mit-media-living-mobile-3 | Kaan: Wristband to Educate Deaf Children about Social Norms | http://dhruvjain.info/me/project-kaan.html | description:Dhruv Jain and Chris Schmandt For young children with hearing loss, learning is difficult and their social development is often at risk. This physical impairment causes changes in their social behavior, and they may be deemed "socially awkward" from a task as simple as setting down an object. It is hard for them to sense the sound distinction to know if an object was set down in a polite manner or if it was disruptive to others. Kaan is a wearable wristband to signal and alert a person with hearing loss if the sound emitted from setting down an object is disruptive. The long-term goal is to educate children on acceptable ranges of motions of objects in their everyday lives. The current device consists of a wearable wristband that vibrates and emits light if the loudness of the sound around it goes beyond a certain threshold. view site
mit-media-living-mobile-4 | MugShots | http://speech.media.mit.edu/projects/mugshots/ | description:Cindy Hsin-Liu Kao and Chris Schmandt MugShots enables visual communication though everyday objects. We embed a small display into a coffee mug–an object with frequent daily use. Targeted for the workplace, the mug transitions between different communication modes in public and private spaces. In the private office space, the mug is an object for intimate communication between remote friends; users receive emoticon stickers via the display. When brought to a public area, the mug switches to a pre-selected image of the user's choice, serving as a social catalyst to trigger conversations in public spaces. view site

Using capacitive sensing on printed electrodes, the interface can distinguish on-nail finger swipe gestures with high accuracy. NailO works in real time: we miniaturized the system to fit on the fingernail, while wirelessly transmitting the sensor data to a mobile phone or PC. NailO allows for one-handed and always-available input, while being unobtrusive and discreet. Inspired by commercial nail stickers, the device blends into the user’s body, is customizable, fashionable, and even removable. We show example applications of using the device as a remote controller when hands are busy and using the system to increase the input space of mobile phones.
mit-media-living-mobile-6 | OnTheGo | http://living.media.mit.edu/projects/onthego/ | description:Misha Sra, Chris Schmandt As mobile device screens continue to get smaller (smartwatches, head-mounted devices like Google Glass), touch-based interactions with them become harder. With OnTheGo, our goal is to complement touch- and voice-based input on these devices by adding interactions through in-air gestures around the devices. Gestural interactions are not only intuitive for certain situations where touch may be cumbersome like running, skiing, or cooking, but are also convenient for things like quick application and task management, certain types of navigation and interaction, and simple inputs to applications. view site
mit-media-living-mobile-7 | Spotz | http://web.media.mit.edu/~sra | description:Chris Schmandt and Misha Sra Exploring your city is a great way to make friends, discover new places, find new interests, and invent yourself. Spotz is an Android app where everyone collectively defines the places they visit and the places in turn define them. Spotz allows you to discover yourself by discovering places. You tag a spot and create some buzz for it; if everyone agrees the spot is fun this bolsters your "fun" quotient. If everyone agrees the spot is geeky it pushes up your "geeky" score. Thus emerges your personal tag cloud. Follow tags to chance upon new places. Find people with similar tag clouds as your own and experience new places together. Create buzz for your favorite spots and track other buzz to find who has the #bestchocolatecake in town! view site
mit-media-living-mobile-8 | Variable Reality: Interaction with the Virtual Book | http://living.media.mit.edu/projects/variablereality/ | description:Hye Soo Yang and Chris Schmandt Variable Reality is an augmented reality system designed for reading digital and physical books more intuitively and efficiently. Through a head-worn display device such as Oculus Rift, the user is able to instantly access and display any desired book contents onto either a real book or a hand, depending on the need and affordability. Quick hand gestures integrated with the system further facilitate natural user interactions. view site
