To help comprehend this promising but chaotic new public sphere, we're building a "social news machine" that will provide a structured view of the place where journalism meets social media. The basis of our project is a two-headed data ingest. On one side, all the news published online 24/7 by a sample group of influential US media outlets. On the other, all Twitter comments of the journalists who produced the stories. The two streams will be joined through network analysis and algorithmic inference. In future work we plan to expand the analysis to include all the journalism produced by major news outlets and the overall public response on Twitter, shedding new light on such issues as bias, originality, credibility, and impact.

For the last four years, Jun has been using Twitter as its principal medium for citizen-government communication. We are mapping the resulting social networks and analyzing the dynamics of the Twitter interactions, in order to better understand the initiative’s impact on the town. Our long-term goal is to determine if the system can be replicated at scale in larger communities, perhaps even major cities.
mit-media-social-machines-3 | Rumor Gauge: Automatic Detection and Verification of Rumors in Twitter | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=mit-media-social-machines-3 Rumor Gauge: Automatic Detection and Verification of Rumors in Twitter | description:Soroush Vosoughi and Deb Roy The spread of malicious or accidental misinformation in social media, especially in time-sensitive situations such as real-world emergencies, can have harmful effects on individuals and society. Motivated by this, we are creating computational models of false and true information on Twitter to investigate the nature of rumors surrounding real-world events. These models take into account the content, characteristics of the people involved, and virality of information to predict veracity. The models have been trained and evaluated on several real-world events, such as the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the 2014 Ferguson riots, and the Ebola epidemic, with promising results. We believe our system will have immediate real-world applications for consumers of news, journalists, and emergency services, and that it can help minimize and dampen the impact of misinformation.

While there are a number of educational technology solutions being developed for individuals, the role of “social machines”—or social literacy learning—is less explored. We believe that the gateway to literacy is best passed by a child aided by a supportive community network comprising peers, teachers, parents, and other members. By creating social learning machine technology, we hope to empower human learning networks in order to establish a nutrient medium for literacy growth while enhancing personal, creative, and autonomous interactions within communities. We are planning to pilot and deploy our solution in rural India, where the need for literacy solutions is particularly acute. India currently accounts for 37 percent of world’s illiterate population (282 million Indians).
