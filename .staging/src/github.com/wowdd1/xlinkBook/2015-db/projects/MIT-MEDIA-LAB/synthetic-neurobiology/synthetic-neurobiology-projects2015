mit-media-synthetic-neurobiology-1 | Optogenetics and Synthetic Biology Tools | http://syntheticneurobiology.org/projects/display/60/24 | description:Amy Chuong, Daniel Martin-Alarcon, Kate Adamala, Or Shemesh, Guangyu Xu, Katriona Guthrie-Honea, Aimei Yang, Deniz Aksel, Ellena Popova We have pioneered the development of fully genetically encoded reagents that, when targeted to specific cells, enable their physiology to be controlled via light, as well as other specific manipulations of cellular biological processes. Optogenetic tools enable temporally precise control of neural electrical activity, cellular signaling, and other high-speed physiological processes using light. Other tools we are developing enable the control and monitoring of protein translation and other key cell biological processes. Such tools are being explored throughout neuroscience and bioengineering, for the study and repair of brain circuits. Derived from the natural world, these tools highlight the power of ecological diversity, in yielding technologies for analyzing biological complexity and addressing human health. We distribute these tools as freely as possible. view site

High throughput molecular and physiological analysis methods may also open up new diagnostic possibilities. We are assessing, often in collaborations with other groups, the translational possibilities opened up by our technologies, exploring the safety and efficacy of our technologies in multiple animal models, in order to discover potential applications of our tools to various clinically relevant scenarios. New kinds of "brain co-processor" may be possible which can work efficaciously with the brain to augment its computational abilities, e.g., in the context of cognitive, emotional, sensory, or motor disability. view site
mit-media-synthetic-neurobiology-3 | Tools for Mapping the Molecular Structure of the Brain | http://syntheticneurobiology.org/projects/display/57/25 | description:Daniel Oran, Pablo Valdes, Alex Wissner-Gross, Fei Chen, Linyi Gao, Sam Rodriques, Paul Tillberg, Asmamaw "Oz" Wassie, Shahar Alon, Jae-Byum Chang, Ru Wang, Yongxin Zhao, Manos Karagiannis, Adam Marblestone, Alexander Clifton, Jeremy Wohlwend, Andrew Payn Brain circuits are large, 3D structures. However, the building blocks–proteins, signaling complexes, synapses–are organized with nanoscale precision. This presents a fundamental tension in neuroscience–to understand a neural circuit, you might need to map a large diversity of nanoscale building blocks, across an extended spatial expanse. We are developing a new suite of tools that enable the mapping of the location and identity of the molecular building blocks of the brain, so that comprehensive taxonomies of cells, circuits, and computations might someday become possible, even in entire brains. One of the technologies we are developing enables large, 3D objects to be imaged with nanoscale precision, by physically expanding the sample–a tool we call expansion microscopy (ExM). We are working to improve expansion microscopy further, and are working, often in interdisciplinary collaborations, on a suite of new labeling and analysis techniques to enable multiplexed readout. view site

Ideally it would be possible to observe the activity of many neurons with as great a degree of precision as possible, so as to understand the neural codes and dynamics that are produced by the circuits of the brain. Our lab and our collaborators are developing a number of innovations to enable such analyses. These tools will hopefully enable pictures of how neurons work together to implement brain computations, and how these computations go awry in brain disorders. Such neural observation strategies may also serve as detailed biomarkers of brain disorders or indicators of potential drug side effects. These technologies may, in conjunction with optogenetics, enable closed-loop neural control technologies, which can introduce information into the brain as a function of brain state ("brain co-processors"). view site

These studies may yield fundamental insights into how best to go about treating brain disorders. view site
