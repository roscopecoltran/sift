sri-project-1 | DMET Genes, Nicotine Metabolism, and Prospective Abstinence | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/dmet-genes-nicotine-metabolism-and-prospective-abstinence | description:Researchers are seeking to identify novel genes contributing to nicotine metabolism and to smoking cessation.
sri-project-2 | Role of Alpha6 Nicotinic Receptors in Smoking | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/role-alpha-6-nicotinic-receptors-smoking | description:To support more effective cessation treatments, SRI researchers are exploring how nicotinic receptors affect brain activity in response to smoking.
sri-project-3 | Role of Nicotinic Receptors in Parkinson’s Disease | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/role-nicotinic-receptors-parkinsons-disease | description:SRI is investigating whether the nicotine in tobacco smoke may be useful in meeting the urgent need to manage Parkinson’s disease.
sri-project-4 | Salivary Biomarkers, Life Stress & Nicotine Dependence | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/salivary-biomarkers-life-stress-nicotine-dependence | description:This project could advance drug abuse prevention and intervention research by identifying Genetic x Environment (GxE) interactions, which may help explain the development of nicotine dependence. Results may guide development of tailored interventions.
sri-project-5 | Sleep and Reproductive Transitions in Menopausal Women | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/sleep-quality-menopausal-women | description:Sleep complaints are common during the transition to menopause, yet we have little understanding of what drives this increase in sleep disturbance and how best to treat it. SRI researchers are investigating sleep quality in women who have begun to go through menopause.
sri-project-6 | Treatment of Nicotine Dependence in a Healthcare Setting | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/treatment-nicotine-dependence-health-care-setting | description:SRI is analyzing the genetics of smoking and related characteristics, using data from a large-scale National Cancer Institute study on smoking cessation.
sri-project-7 | Twin Research Registry at SRI International | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/twin-research-registry-sri-international | description:SRI established the Twin Research Registry as part of its scientific research and efforts to discover more about human behavior. Fraternal and identical twins and multiples of all ages are invited to join the Registry for consideration for research studies.
sri-project-8 | Using Twins to Understand Opioid Efficacy | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/using-twins-understand-opioid-efficacy | description:SRI studied twins to gain more clinical insight into physiologic response to powerful opioid painkillers. Study results should help to optimize pain relief and minimize adverse effects.
sri-project-9 | Vaccinations and Next-Generation Pandemic Respiratory Viruses | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/protective-mechanisms-against-next-generation-pandemics | description:To help prepare for next-generation pandemics, SRI is partnering with Stanford University to examine vaccination responses.
