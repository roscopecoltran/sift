sri-project-1 | Biodosimeter to Triage Exposure to Ionizing Radiation | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/biodosimeter-triage-exposure-ionizing-radiation | description:In a nuclear or radiological incident, first responders must quickly measure the radiation exposure of a large number of individuals, since treatment options are radiation dose-dependent and time-sensitive. SRI is developing a biodosimeter to meet this critical challenge.
sri-project-2 | Early Detection Tool for Neglected Tropical Diseases | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/early-detection-tool-neglected-tropical-diseases | description:SRI is developing a novel point-of-care tool for the early detection of devastating diseases.
sri-project-3 | Portable Bioanalysis System | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/sentinel-portable-bioanalysis-system | description:From raw sample to molecular results in minutes: The Sentinel Nucleic Acid Analysis System offers portable, real-time diagnosis of health conditions.
sri-project-4 | Robust Biometric Recognition | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/robust-biometric-recognition | description:SRI International is developing a system that delivers affordable, accurate iris recognition of moving subjects at a distance.
sri-project-5 | Silicon/Air Battery for “Vanishing” Electronic Systems | http://www.sri.com/work/projects/silicon-air-battery-vanishing-electronics | description:To meet an important military challenge, SRI is designing a sensor system that can disappear on command.
