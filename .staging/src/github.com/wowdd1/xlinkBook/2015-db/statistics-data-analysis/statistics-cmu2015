STA36459 | Statistical Models of the Brain | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36459&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Kass, Robert prereq:36401 description:This new course is intended for CNBC students, as an additional  option for fulfilling the computational core course requirement,  but it will also be open to Statistics and Machine Learning  students. It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise'' components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking

STA36702 | Statistical Machine Learning | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36702&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Wasserman, Larry Tibshirani, Ryan prereq:(10705 or 36705) and (10701 or 10715) description:Statistical Machine Learning is a second graduate level course in advanced machine learning, assuming that students have taken Machine Learning (10-701) or Advanced Machine Learning (10-715), and Intermediate Statistics (36-705). The term ?statistical? in the title reflects the emphasis on statistical theory and methodology. This course is mostly focused on methodology and theoretical foundations. It treats both the ?art? of designing good learning algorithms and the ?science? of analyzing an algorithm?s statistical properties and performance guarantees. Theorems are presented together with practical aspects of methodology and intuition to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and approaches to problems in their own research.  Though computation is certainly a critical component of what makes a method successful, it will not receive the same central focus as methodology and theory. We will cover topics in statistical theory that are important for researchers in machine learning, including consistency, minimax estimation, and concentration of measure. We will also cover statistical topics that may not be covered in as much depth in other machine learning courses, such as nonparametric density estimation, nonparametric regression, and Bayesian estimation.
STA36705 | Intermediate Statistics | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36705&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Wasserman, Larry description:This course covers the fundamentals of theoretical statistics. Topics  include: probability inequalities, point and interval estimation, minimax theory, hypothesis testing, data reduction, convergence concepts, Bayesian inference, nonparametric statistics, bootstrap resampling, VC dimension, prediction and model selection.
STA36707 | Regression Analysis | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36707&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Ventura, Valerie description:This is a course in data analysis using mutiple linear regression. Topics covered include simple linear regression, ordinary least squares and weighted least squares, the geometry of least squares, quadratic forms, F tests and ANOVA tables, residuals, outlier detection, and identification of influential observations, variable selection methods, and modern regression techniques. Essential background in linear algebra is reviewed where necessary. When time permits other topics such as nonlinear regression and robust estimation will be discussed. Practice in data analysis is obtained through course projects.
STA36720 | Discrete Mutlivariate Analysis | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36720&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Fienberg, Stephen Sadinle Garcia-Ruiz, Mauricio prereq:36705 or 36707 description:This course introduces students to a rich statistical literature on the analysis of cross-classified categorical data, i.e., data in the form of a multidimensional contingency table. The typical goal in these analyses is to discover and quantify relationships among categorical variables. Some classic questions that can be approached using methods covered in this course are ``is attitude towards legalized abortion associated with years of schooling'' or ``is there gender bias in graduate admissions to a certain school.'' This course will help students develop a critical approach to the analysis of contingency table data, especially using log-linear and logit models. The course will cover basic theory, linking the methods to those of the separate literatures on generalized linear models and graphical models. Students will analyze many different kinds of contingency table data coming from social and biological sciences using various tools in R. Prerequisites: Statistics 36-705 and 36-707 or permission of the instructors.
STA36721 | Statistical Graphics and Visualization | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36721&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Thomas, Andrew description:Graphical displays of quantitative information take on many forms to help us understand both data and models. This course will serve to introduce the student to the most common forms of graphical displays and their uses and misuses. Students will learn both how to create these displays and how to understand them. The class will also cover some principles of visual perception and estimation. We will start with univariate and bivariate data, looking at some commonly used graphs and, after discussing their advantages/disadvantages, then turning to more sophisticated tools. We will then explore some three-dimensional tools, group structure/clustering, and projections of higher dimensional data. As time permits, the course will consider some more advanced graphical models such as statistical maps, networks, and the usage of icons.

STA36759 | Statistical Models of the Brain: Statistical Models of the Brain | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36759&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Kass, Robert description:This new course is intended for CNBC students, as an additional  option for fulfilling the computational core course requirement,  but it will also be open to Statistics and Machine Learning  students. It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise'' components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking
