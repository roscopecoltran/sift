STAT100 | Introduction to Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences and Humanities | http://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/1224/assignments/syllabus | instructors:Luke Miratrix http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/luke-miratrix description:This course introduces the basic concepts of statistical inference and statistical computing, both increasingly used in the social sciences and the humanities. The emphasis of this course is on statistical reasoning, visualization, data analysis, and use of statistical software instead of theory. The goal is to provide pragmatic tools for assessing statistical claims and conducting basic statistical analyses. The main areas covered are classic one- and two-sample statistics, regression with one or more predictors, and bootstrap and randomization based inference. The course explores applications in a wide range of fields, including the social and political sciences, medical research, and psychology. Students may count one of the following courses toward a degree, but not all four: STAT E-100, STAT E-101, STAT E-102, or STAT E-104. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Statistics 100. (4 credits) 
STAT101 | Introduction to Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences | http://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/1674 | instructors:Max Krasnow http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/max-krasnow description:This course provides a theoretical background and practical experience to statistics for psychology and other behavioral sciences. Statistics are the tools we use to summarize and describe the world around us and to explore the causal processes at work. Understanding statistics and how they are used and misused is vital to assimilating information as an informed citizen, as well as pursuing a career in the behavioral sciences or similar fields. In this course, we cover topics including principles of measurement, measures of central tendency and variability, probability and distributions, correlation and regression, hypothesis testing, t-tests, analysis of variance, and chi-square tests. Students may count one of the following courses toward a degree, but not all four: STAT E-100, STAT E-101, STAT E-102, or STAT E-104. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Psychology 1900. (4 credits) 
STAT102 | Fundamentals of Biostatistics | http://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/1944 | instructors:Bernard A. Rosner http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/bernard-rosner description:This course is an introduction to statistical methods used in biological and medical research. Elementary probability theory, basic concepts of statistical inference, regression and correlation methods, analysis of variance, and study design are covered. Emphasis on applications to medical problems. Students may count one of the following courses toward a degree, but not all four: STAT E-100, STAT E-101, STAT E-102, or STAT E-104. (4 credits) 
STAT104 | Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics and Other Quantitative Fields | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14527/2014/fall | instructors:Michael I. Parzen http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/michael-i-parzen description:A rigorous introduction to statistics for students intending to study economics and other quantitative fields. Examples are drawn from finance, decision analysis, and economic decision making. In addition to descriptive statistics, probability, inference, and regression modeling, this course also covers portfolio creation, decision analysis, and time series analysis. Students with prior exposure to introductory statistics will find some overlap of material but will be exposed to new applications and learn more advanced modeling techniques. The statistical software package Stata is used. Harvard has a site license for the software so it does not need to be purchased. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Statistics 104. Students may count one of the following courses toward a degree, but not all four: STAT E-100, STAT E-101, STAT E-102, or STAT E-104. (4 credits) 
STAT150 | Statistical Methods | http://isites.harvard.edu/course/ext-14567/2014/fall | instructors:Stephanie McMains http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/stephanie-mcmains description:This intermediate statistics course is intended to give students familiarity with statistical tools used to analyze data in a variety of disciplines, including psychology, and provides experience reading and understanding studies based on data analysis. Topics include multiple regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance, repeated measures, transformation of data, and nonparametric methods. These topics are explored using the statistical package SPSS, with a focus on understanding how to use and interpret SPSS output. (4 credits) 
STAT190 | Quantitative Research Methodology | http://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/951 | instructors:Matthew Blackwell http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/matthew-blackwell description:This course is an introduction to statistical research in the social sciences with a focus on applied multiple linear regression from both a descriptive and causal inference perspective. The primary goal of this course is to provide students with the necessary skills to critically read, interpret, and replicate the quantitative content of social science research. Course content focuses on political science in particular. Formerly GOVT E-2000. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Government 1000. (4 credits) 
STAT200 | Advanced Quantitative Research Methodology | http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001/book/syllabus | instructors:Gary King http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/gary-king description:This course introduces the theories of inference underlying most statistical methods. It covers how new approaches to research methods, data analysis, and statistical theory are developed. With this foundation, we introduce (and reinvent) a wide variety of known statistical solutions to a wide range of social science data problems. We also show how it is easy to conceive original approaches and new statistical estimators when required. The specific models introduced are chosen based on students' research topics. In past years they have included models for event counts, ecological inference, time-series cross-sectional analysis, compositional data, causal inference, and case-control designs. Formerly GOVT E-2001. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Government 1002. (4 credits)
