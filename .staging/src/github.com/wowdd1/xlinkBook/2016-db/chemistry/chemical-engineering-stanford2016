CHEMENG12SC | An Exploration of Art Materials:  The Intersection of Art and Science | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=CHEMENG12SC | instructors:Frank, C. (PI); Loesch-Frank, S. (PI) description:There is growing interest in the intersection of art and science, whether from artists adapting technology to suit their visions or from scientists and engineers seeking to explain various visual effects.  To take advantage of possible creative sparks at the art/science interface, it is necessary for fuzzies and techies to have some knowledge of the language used by the other side.  This interface will be explored through examining approaches used by an artist and an engineer in the context of the materials science of cultural objects.  In-class lectures, hands-on studio practice, and field trips will be used to illustrate these different perspectives.  At the heart of the scientific approach is the notion that a cultural object, e.g., a painting, is a physical entity comprising materials with different physical properties and different responses to environmental stresses presented by light, heat, and water.  In support of this outlook, in-class lectures and discussions will focus on the basic concepts of color, optics, mechanics, composite structures, and response of the object to environmental stress, and we will visit Bay Area museums to see how artists employ such techniques. The hands-on studio experience is designed to increase students' confidence and develop their appreciation of differences in materials.  It is not necessary to have any artistic training, only a willingness to experiment.  The in-class studio projects will include working with line and shadow; color, binders, and mordants; global sources of pigments; substrates and writing; and material failure. Students will make one technical presentation on a topic in one of the five areas relevant to a painting:  color, optics, mechanics, composites, and stress response.  In addition, they will prepare one essay on the issues surrounding the intersection of art and science.  Finally, they will complete a project related to one of the thematic areas covered in the hands-on studio sessions and make a final oral presentation describing their project.

(PI) description:Complex fluid interfaces arise whenever amphiphiles (surfactants, phospholipids, polymers, colloidal particles) collect at liquid-fluid surfaces, imbuing them with nonlinear mechanical responses. Examples in nature include the cell membrane, lung surfactants, and the tear film. Industrial applications include emulsions and foams that require stabilization. The course discusses concepts in capillarity and wetting, interfacial fluid dynamics, thin film stability, the microstructure of self-organized monolayers and bilayers. Experimental microstructural methods (Brewster angle microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, grazing incidence x-ray diffraction) will be described.  Prerequisite: 310 or equivalent.
CHEMENG482 | The Startup Garage: Design (SOMGEN 282) | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=CHEMENG482 | instructors: description:(Same as STRAMGT 356) The Startup Garage is an experiential lab course that focuses on the design, testing and launch of  a new venture. Multidisciplinary student teams work through an iterative process of understanding user needs, creating a point of view statement, ideating and prototyping new product and services and their business models, and communicating the user need, product, service and business models to end-users, partners, and investors. In the autumn quarter, teams will: identify and validate a compelling user need and develop very preliminary prototypes for a new product or service and business models. Students form teams, conduct field work and iterate on the combination of business model -- product -- market. Teams will present their first prototypes (business model - product - market) at the end of the quarter to a panel of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, angel investors and faculty.

(SI); Siegelman, R. (SI); Wood, D. (SI) description:This is the second quarter of the two-quarter series. In this quarter, student teams expand the field work they started in the fall quarter. They get out of the building to talk to potential customers, partners, distributors, and investors to test and refine their business model, product/service and market. This quarter the teams will be expected to develop and test a minimally viable product, iterate, and focus on validated lessons on: the market opportunity, user need and behavior, user interactions with the product or service, business unit economics, sale and distribution models, partnerships, value proposition, and funding strategies. Teams will interact with customers, partners, distributors, investors and mentors with the end goal of developing and delivering a funding pitch to a panel of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, angel investors and faculty.
