STA36147 | Freshman Seminar: Where is Everybody?: Freshman Seminar | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36147&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Freeman, Peter description:While eating lunch with colleagues in 1950, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked a seemingly innocuous question: "Where is everybody?" He was referring to extraterrestrials: any advanced civilization with rockets, curiosity, and willpower should have colonized the entire Milky Way by now. But we've seen no evidence of life anywhere beyond Earth. Indeed, where are all the extraterrestrials?Throughout this course, we will consider various answers to what is now known as Fermi's Paradox, and use it as a springboard to learning about, among other things, exoplanets, astrobiology, and all the bad, extinction-causing events that could happen here tomorrow and that could have wiped out extraterrestrials in the past. You will synthesize what you learn by using it to inform Op-Ed-style articles and blog entries, as well as oral presentations. You will also be introduced to the statistical package R, which you will apply in simple data analyses. Note that in the multiverse, you have enjoyed taking this class an infinite number of times. Welcome back!
STA36148 | Freshman Seminar: Networks: Where do they come from?  What do they tell us?: Networks | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36148&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Nugent, Rebecca description:Thirty years ago, the word "network" was mostly used in reference to computers or television broadcasting channels.  Now we have networks of friends, enemies, phones, stars, tweets, international governments, terrorists, etc.  Where do these networks come from?  How are they built?  What do they represent?  As we learn more about how everything is connected, we also face challenges in trying to understand the data that a network can generate.  In this course, you'll learn about networks from a New England monastery facing a political crisis to social groups of friends (is obesity contagious?  what about divorce?) to 15th century marriages among prominent Italian families to international political disputes and skirmishes (is the enemy of my enemy my friend?) to the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users.  Along the way, we'll explore how to describe, visualize, analyze, and even break down the networks that surround us.

The term ?statistical? in the title reflects the emphasis on statistical theory and methodology. This course is mostly focused on methodology and theoretical foundations. It treats both the ?art? of designing good learning algorithms and the ?science? of analyzing an algorithm?s statistical properties and performance guarantees. Theorems are presented together with practical aspects of methodology and intuition to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and approaches to problems in their own research.  Though computation is certainly a critical component of what makes a method successful, it will not receive the same central focus as methodology and theory. We will cover topics in statistical theory that are important for researchers in machine learning, including consistency, minimax estimation, and concentration of measure. We will also cover statistical topics that may not be covered in as much depth in other machine learning courses, such as nonparametric density estimation, nonparametric regression, and Bayesian estimation.

We will then explore some three-dimensional tools, group structure/clustering, and projections of higher dimensional data. As time permits, the course will consider some more advanced graphical models such as statistical maps, networks, and the usage of icons.
STA36723 | Hidden Markov Models: Theory and Applications: Tbd | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36723&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Rodu, Jordan description:Hidden Markov models (HMM) are a critical part of any data scientist's toolbox.  HMMs have been extensively used in applications ranging from speech processing to biological sciences, robotics, finance, and social sciences.  In this class we will investigate all aspects of the standard HMM and its variants, from theory the state of the art estimation techniques.  A key component of the course will focus on the practical aspects of HMM implementation including its wide range of applications.
STA36725 | Convex Optimization | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36725&SEMESTER=F15 | instructors:Tibshirani, Ryan description:Nearly every problem in machine learning can be formulated as the optimization of some function, possibly under some set of constraints.  This universal reduction may seem to suggest that such optimization tasks are intractable. Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics.  Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. Though not required, having taken 10-701 or an equivalent machine learning or statistics class is strongly encouraged, since we will use applications in machine learning and statistics to demonstrate the concepts we cover in class.  Students will work on an extensive optimization-based project throughout the semester; those wanting to take the class without the project can register under the 9 unit option.

STA36759 | Statistical Models of the Brain: Statistical Models of the BrainThis Section Cancelled | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36759&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Rodu, Jordan description:This new course is intended for CNBC students, as an additional  option for fulfilling the computational core course requirement,  but it will also be open to Statistics and Machine Learning  students. It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise'' components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking
STA36762 | Data Privacy | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36762&SEMESTER=F15 | instructors:Fienberg, Stephen description:Protection of individual data is a growing problem due to the large amount of sensitive and personal data being collected, stored, analyzed, and shared across multiple domains and stakeholders. Researchers are facing new policies and technical requirements imposed by funding agencies on accessing and sharing of the research data. This course will introduce students to (1) key principles associated with the concepts of confidentiality and privacy protection, and (2) techniques for data sharing that support useful statistical inference while minimizing the disclosure of sensitive personal information.  Methodologies to be considered will include tools for disclosure limitation used by government statistical agencies and those associated with the approach known as differential privacy which provides a formal privacy guaranteed.  Students will explore specific techniques using special tools in R.
