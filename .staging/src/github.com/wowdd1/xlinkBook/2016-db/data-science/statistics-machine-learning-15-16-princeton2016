SML302 | Fundamentals of Machine Learning | http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring16/cos424 | instructors:Barbara Engelhardt description:Computers have made it possible, even easy, to collect vast amounts of data from a wide variety of sources.  It is not always clear, however, how to use those data, and how to extract useful information from them.  This problem is faced in a tremendous range of business and scientific applications.  This course will focus on some of the most useful approaches to the problem of analyzing large complex data sets, exploring both theoretical foundations and practical applications.  Students will gain experience analyzing several types of data, including text, images, and biological data.
SML101 | Reasoning with Data | http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=013595&term=1164 | instructors:description:Data-driven decision-making, research discovery, and technology development are everywhere.  It is now more important than ever for individuals to understand how data are used for these purposes. This course will introduce the student to how statistical reasoning and methods are used to learn from and leverage modern data. The emphasis will be on concepts and strategies for learning from data, rather than on sophisticated mathematics.  Students will be exposed to the basics of statistics, machine learning, and data science through real world problems and applications.  Students will also analyze data sets using the computer.
SML201 | Introduction to Data Science | http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=013596&term=1164 | instructors:John D. Storey description:This course provides an introduction to the burgeoning field of data science, which is primarily concerned with data-driven discovery and utilizing data as a research and technology development tool. We cover approaches and techniques for obtaining, organizing, exploring, and analyzing data, as well as creating tools based on data. Elements of statistics, machine learning, and statistical computing form the basis of the course content. We consider applications in the natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering.
