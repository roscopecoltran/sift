We will work with historical data sets to "discover" Malthusian economics and model economic relationships that governed the human condition up until the mid-1700's.  We will then move on to the industrial revolution and "discover" the role of technology, culminating in an overview of modern thinking about economic growth.  Questions we will consider as well as looking at looking at the current public policy responses to them are:  Why are some countries rich and some are poor?  Why have some countries experienced rapid economic development; what can be done to foster development of others that continue to languish?  Does education lead to increased household wealth and national wealth?  How are new technologies affecting economic development and economic opportunities?  Can we improve design of electronic markets to take advantage of the vast opportunities for trade and exchange afforded by by the internet? (Lecture, 3 hours)

In this course, we will use the emerging field of social networks to put structure on this diverse mass of connections. Using a mixture of theoretical, empirical, and computational methods, we will learn about the structure and function of social networks. We will look at how an individual's position in a social network reflects her role in the community. We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure.
