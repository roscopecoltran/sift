ELE574 | Security Privacy in Computing and Comm | http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=012709&term=1162 | instructors:Prateek Mittal description:As our society transitions towards an information-driven paradigm, concerns about security and privacy of computing and communication have come to a forefront.  This course exposes students to foundational principles and mechanisms that enable security and privacy in computing and communications.  In addition, we study the interdisciplinary dimension of security and privacy by exploring its intersections with machine learning, information theory, computer architecture and formal methods.
ELE575 | Parallel Computation | http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=012783&term=1162 | instructors:David Wentzlaff description:The class reads seminal papers on different parallel programming models and computer architectures.  In addition, we explore different parallel programming models via programming assignments.  Finally the course culminates in a project where students create a research-grade experiment and write a full length conference-style paper.  One of the goals of this class is to get students introduced to writing a complete conference style computer architecture/CS paper.
ELE580A | Advanced Topics in Computer Engineering: RF and High-speed Circuits and Systems | http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=002566&term=1162 | instructors:Kaushik Sengupta description:The course covers topics related to design of high-frequency and high-speed circuits, both at the transistor and system-level, with emphasis on design of modern RF and wireless communication ICs. The topics covered are basic RF design concepts, modern integrated circuit technologies (such as SiGe and CMOS), fundamental limitations of speed of operation of transistors, high-frequency and wideband amplifiers, low-noise amplifiers, concepts of impedance matching, physics of noise, frequency-translational circuits such as mixers, oscillators and phase noise, frequency-synthesis and phase-locked loops.
