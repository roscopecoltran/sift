ud615 | Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes - Master infrastructure management | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud615 | available:yes level:intermediate instructors:Carter Morgan, Kelsey Hightower description:This course is designed to teach you about managing application containers, using Kubernetes. We've built this course in partnership with experts such as Kelsey Hightower and Carter Morgan from Google and Netflix’s former Cloud Architect, Adrian Cockcroft (current Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures), who provide critical learning throughout the course. Mastering highly resilient and scalable infrastructure management is very important, because the modern expectation is that your favorite sites will be up 24/7, and that they will roll out new features frequently and without disruption of the service. Achieving this requires tools that allow you to ensure speed of development, infrastructure stability and ability to scale. Students with backgrounds in Operations or Development who are interested in managing container based infrastructure with Kubernetes are recommended to enroll!In this course you will learn to: - Containerize an application by creating Docker config files and build processes to produce all the necessary Docker images - Configure and launch an auto-scaling, self-healing Kubernetes cluster - Use Kubernetes to manage deploying, scaling, and updating your applications - Employ best practices for using containers in general, and specifically Kubernetes, when architecting and developing new microservices
ud513 | Technical Interview - Algorithms and Data Structures in Python | https://www.udacity.com/course/ud513 | available:yes level:intermediate instructor description:Are you ready to conquer your next interview? To succeed, you need to understand the expectations. Virtually all technical interviews follow a very set pattern: you get asked a very specific type of question, you're required to have very specific knowledge, and you're expected to answer—and interact with your interviewer—in a very particular way. Knowing this in advance, and preparing accordingly, is the key to success. This course was designed to give you what you need to ace a technical interview. Included are: - videos that walk you through the algorithms and data structures concepts commonly asked in technical interviews - an explanation of efficiency, and an explanation of how it relates to topics covered throughout the class - practice problems and quizzes to test your understanding - a mock interview with a breakdown explaining how interviewers expect you to explain your thought process - curated links to outside resources, including a special link to live practice interviewing with other Udacity students on Pramp  - if you’re a Nanodegree student, a final project where you can answer interview questions and get feedback from a trained reviewer.The goal of this course is to prepare you for a real technical interview, so we focus on the material you'll actually be expected to do.
