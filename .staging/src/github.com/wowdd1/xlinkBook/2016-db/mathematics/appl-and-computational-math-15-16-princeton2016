APC199 | Math Alive | http://www.math.princeton.edu/matalive | instructors:Ian M. Griffiths Adam W. Marcus description:Mathematics has profoundly changed our world, from the way we communicate with each other and listen to music, to banking and computers.  This course is designed for those without college mathematics who want to understand the mathematical concepts behind important modern applications. The course consists of individual modules, each focusing on a particular application (e.g., digital music, sending secure emails, and using statistics to explain, or hide, facts). The emphasis is on ideas, not on sophisticated mathematical techniques, but there will be substantial problem-set requirements. Students will learn by doing simple examples.
