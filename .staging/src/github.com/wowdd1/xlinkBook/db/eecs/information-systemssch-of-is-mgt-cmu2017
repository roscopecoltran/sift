Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions. The key to such optimal decision- making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance.   The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models. We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions. These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition. As we go through this analysis, we will seek to understand the implications of the theory for information technology firms. We will also examine interesting dynamics between information, agents and economic outcomes in the context of game theory.

In this course we will spend some time (1/5? 1/4? 1/3? on the programming language that accompanies Excel: Visual Basic for Application (a.k.a. VBA). MISM students have already had a good dose of programming in Java (and perhaps other languages as well), so I feel that learning a language as basic as...Basic should be easy and hopefully enjoyable. Given that VBA is tightly coupled to the spreadsheet Excel (which itself is a major thrust of a modern DMUU course), seems all the more reason to look carefully at it. Most serious programmers tend to look down on VBA, sometimes for good reason,but I think you will and that it is a reasonably complete (non-object-oriented, but object-based) language worthy of of a MISM students time.

ISM95885 | Data Science and Big Data | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=95885&SEMESTER=S17 | instructors:Sooriamurthi, Raja description:From empirical, to theoretical, to computational science, we are at the dawn of a new revolution---a fourth paradigm of science driven by data. Like archaeological remnants, data, by its very nature, is a marker of what happened in the past. How can data be used to better understand this past and what is happening in the present? How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations. The real excitement of data science is in the doing. This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools. While prior programming experience with Python will be helpful the course will strive to be self-contained. If you have not programmed in Python before, you need to be comfortable programming in some language (e.g., Ruby, R, Java, C++) and will need to come up to speed with the Pythonic way of problem solving.

However, in an enterprise that has complex and expensive IT systems to support its business processes, jumping into the cloud without a clear strategy that is aligned with business goals may produce some short-term wins, but will almost always result in unexpected costs and poorly governed data and applications.  Companies, are routinely making the strategic choice of migrating their software (selling) business model from a traditional perpetual license to a subscription license-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) product.  We will look at the challenges that come about with this change in business strategy.  This course has three objectives: 1)	To critically examine from a business point of view: a.	Implications of Data Center moving to Cloud.  Changing role of IT.   b.	The impact on an existing business to move from their product licensing sales strategy to selling software as a service (focus on pricing, revenue recognition and other pain areas) c.	Opportunities for a new software business starting today 2)	Technology concepts behind service  and delivery models.  Concepts behind building a scalable web application running in the cloud. Focus on PaaS and Streaming frameworks 3)	Application Building (hands on programming)- Building highly available and scalable web-applications   ...Read More  This class CANNOT be audited, and CANNOT be taken on the pass/fail basis.
