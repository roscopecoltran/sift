Programming assignments will be based on analytical tasks that might be faced by scientists and will typically include parsing, statistical analysis, simulation, and optimization. Principles of good software engineering will also be stressed. Most programming assignments will be done in the Go programming language, an industry-supported, modern programming language, the syntax of which will be covered in depth. Several other assignments will be given in other programming languages such as Python and Java to highlight the commonalities and differences between languages. No prior programming experience is assumed, and no biology background is needed. Analytical skills and mathematical maturity are required.No pre/co-reqs, course not open to CS majors.
CB02223 | Personalized Medicine: Understanding Your Own Genome | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=02223&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Kim, Se Young description:Do you want to know how to discover the tendencies hidden in your genome? Since the first draft of a human genome sequence became available about a decade ago, the cost of genome sequencing has decreased dramatically. Personal genome sequencing will likely become a routine part of medical exams for patients for prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Personal genome information will also play an increasing role in lifestyle choices, as people take into account their own genetic tendencies. Commercial services such as 23andMe have already taken first steps in this direction. Computational methods for mining large-scale genome data are being developed to unravel the genetic basis of diseases and assist doctors in clinics.  This course introduces students to biological, computational, and ethical issues concerning use of personal genome information in health maintenance, medical practice, biomedical research, and policymaking. We focus on practical issues, using individual genome sequences (such as that of Nobel prize winner James Watson) and other population-level genome data. Without requiring any background in biology or CS, we begin with an overview of topics from genetics, molecular biology, stats, and machine learning relevant to the modern personal genome era. We then cover scientific issues such as how to discover your genetic ancestry and how to learn from genomes about migration and evolution of human populations. We discuss medical aspects such as how to predict whether you will develop diseases such as diabetes based on your own genome, how to discover disease-causing genetic mutations, and how genetic information can be used to recommend clinical treatments. No prereqs.

Students learn to balance technical product development with customer  requirements, business strategy and budget constraints. This course provides  real world, hands-on learning on what it is like to start a company.  Different business modeling will be covered. By understand customer  discovery and validation concepts will aid students to effectively modify  their original concepts to meet market demands. Student teams will learn how  to revise, improve their prototype by the end of the term. This is a fast  paced course in which students are expected to spend most of the time  outside of the classroom to interact with potential customers to validate,  test, verify, and integrate essentials elements for their start-up business  proposal. Up to now, students have been learning some technologies and  methods for solving problems in the life science industry and build a  prototype for their start-up. However, a new venture proposal is not a  collection of isolated bits. It should be thorough validated via customer's  inputs and market needs to tell a single story of how the venture will reach  its end goals. Final deliverable is creation and presentation of a well  explicated, business proposal in addition to a product prototype  corresponding to the business proposal.
