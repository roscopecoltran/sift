The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.

HCI05432 | Personalized Online Learning | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05432&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Aleven, Vincent description:Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.  The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications.

HCI05671 | HCI Project | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05671&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Ballay, Laura Berntsen, Karen Hong, Jason description:The MHCI Project course is an 8-month long capstone project for the Master's of HCI program and integrates everything the students have learned in their coursework into one "end-to-end" experience. Students work in interdisciplinary teams with an industry sponsor to produce a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of a novel service or product idea. The students come from a variety of backgrounds including Computer Science, Psychology, Design, and other related programs. This year students from the Tepper School of Business will participate on teams during the Spring semester, to help develop business plans for the projects. The industrial client defines the project area and guides its direction. In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. They do weekly iteration cycles, so by the end of the summer, product prototypes are well refined and adapted to user needs. The end goal is a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of the product idea.

The four courses are:  Number Name                                   When             Instruct 05-773 Computer Science Perspectives in HCI   Mini 3-Spring'07 05-772 Social Perspectives in HCI             Mini 4-Spring'07  05-774 Cognitive Science Perspectives in HCI  Mini 3-Spring'08  05-775 Design Perspectives in HCI             Mini 4-Spring'08
HCI05795 | Applications of Cognitive Science | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05795&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Klatzky, Roberta description:The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.
HCI05813 | Human Factors | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05813&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Dabbish, Laura description:This course uses theory and research from human factors, cognitive science,  and social science to understand and design the interactions of humans with  the built world, tools, and technology.  The course emphasizes current work  in applied domains such as automotive design, house construction, medical  human factors, and design of information devices.  The course also will  emphasize not only individual human factors (e.g., visual response,  anthropometry) but also the organizational arrangemenhts that can amplify  or correct human factors problems.    Through reading, discussion, and projects, you will learn about human  perceptual, cognitive, and physical processes that affect how people  interact with, and use, technology and tools.  You will learn why we have  so many automobile accidents, voting irregularities, and injuries from  prescription medication. You will learn some tried and true solutions for  human factors problems, and some of the many problems in human factors that  remain. You will also have gained experience in research in this field.
HCI05814 | Perception | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05814&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Klatzky, Roberta prereq:85102 or 85211 description:Perception, broadly defined, is the construction of a representation of the external world for purposes of thinking and acting. Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it. In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch. We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology. The goals include not only imparting basic knowledge about perception but also providing new insights into everyday experiences.   Prerequisites: 85102 or 85211 or 85213 or 85219
HCI05818 | Design Educational Games | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05818&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Ogan, Amy description:The potential of digital games to improve education is enormous. However, it is a significant challenge to create a game that is both fun and educational. In this course, students will learn to meet this challenge by combining processes and principles from game design and instructional design. Students will also learn to evaluate their games for fun, learning, and the integration of the two. They will be guided by the EDGE framework for the analysis and design educational games. The course will involve a significant hands-on portion in which students learn a design process to create educational games, digital or non-digital. They will also read about existing educational games and discuss game design, instructional design, learning and transfer, and the educational effectiveness of digital games. They will analyze an educational game and present their analysis to the class.  The intended audience includes graduate and advanced undergraduate students in HCII, CS, ETC, Design, and students interested in education or psychology research.   To be eligible to enroll, students must have successfully completed one course in human-computer interaction, game design, computer science, or cognitive/educational psychology, or they must have instructor permission.  During most weeks, we will have a lecture and a course meeting devoted to student game presentations, discussion of homework assignments, and hands-on work. The lecture meetings will be devoted to discussions focused on the course readings. The hands-on part will be opportunities for students to work on assignments and projects, and to discuss progress and open issues with the course instructors.
HCI05820 | Social Web | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05820&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Bigham, Jeffrey description:With the growth of online environments like MySpace, Second Life, World of Warcraft, Wikipedia, blogs, online support groups, and open source development communities, the web is no longer just about information. This course, jointly taught by a computer scientist and a behavioral scientist, will examine a sampling of the social, technical and business challenges social web sites must solve to be successful, teach students how to use high-level tools to analyze, design or build online communities, and help them understand the social impact of spending at least part of their lives online.    This class is open to advanced undergraduates and graduate students with either technical or non-technical backgrounds. Course work will include lectures and class discussion, homework, class presentations, and a group research or design project.
HCI05821 | Applied Research Methods: Qualitative | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05821&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Kiesler, Sara description:This mini (6-week) course is for Ph.D. students who are conducting empirical qualitative research.

HCI05823 | E-Learning Design Principles: E-Learning Design Principles | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05823&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Koedinger, Kenneth description:This course is about e-learning design principles, the evidence and theory behind them, and how to apply these principles to develop effective educational technologies. It is organized around the book "e-Learning and the Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning" by Clark & Mayer with further readings drawn from cognitive science, educational psychology, and human-computer interaction. You will learn design principles 1) for combining words, audio, and graphics in multimedia instruction, 2) for combining examples, explanations, practice and feedback in online support for learning by doing, and 3) for balancing learner versus system control and supporting student metacognition. You will read about the experiments that support these design principles, see examples of how to design such experiments, and practice applying the principles in educational technology development.
HCI05832 | Personalized Online Learning | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05832&SEMESTER=F14 | instructors:Aleven, Vincent description:Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.  The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications. Students should either have some  programming skills or experience in the cognitive psychology of human problem solving, or experience with instructional design.
HCI05833 | Gadgets, Sensors and Activity Recognition in HCI | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05833&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Hudson, Scott description:Recent advances in HCI have been driven by new capabilities to deliver inexpensive devices to users, to display information in mobile and other contexts, to sense the user and their environment, and use these sensors to create models of a user's context and actions.  This course will consider both concepts surrounding these new technological opportunities   through discussion of current literature - and practical considerations  the skills needed to actually build devices.    About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area.  The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: "HCI gadgets"). In particular, the course will concentrate on the basics of building simple microcontroller-based devices and will also provide very basic coverage of the machine learning techniques needed for simple sensor-driven statistical models.    The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student.    There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers. Some coverage of the language used to do this will be provided, and if required by your background, the programming component of the projects can be made comparatively small (but, in that case some other aspect of the projects will need to be expanded). However, you should not take this course if you have no programming background. This course assumes no  background in electronics.
HCI05834 | Applied Machine Learning | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05834&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Rose, Carolyn description:Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.
HCI05836 | Usuable Privacy and Security | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=05836&SEMESTER=S15 | instructors:Cranor, Lorrie description:There is growing recognition that technology alone will not provide all of the solutions to security and privacy problems. Human factors play an important role in these areas, and it is important for security and privacy experts to have an understanding of how people will interact with the systems they develop. This course is designed to introduce students to a variety of usability and user interface problems related to privacy and security and to give them experience in designing studies aimed at helping to evaluate usability issues in security and privacy systems. The course is suitable both for students interested in privacy and security who would like to learn more about usability, as well as for students interested in usability who would like to learn more about security and privacy. Much of the course will be taught in a graduate seminar style in which all students will be expected to do a weekly reading assignment and each week different students will prepare a presentation for the class. Students will also work on a group project throughout the semester. The course is open to all graduate students who have technical backgrounds. The 12-unit course numbers (08-734 and 5-836) are for PhD students and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will be expected to play a leadership role in a group project that produces a paper suitable for publication.  The 9-unit 500-level course numbers (08-534 and 05-436) are for juniors, seniors, and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will  have less demanding project and presentation requirements.
