Wieschaus description:An integrated, mathematically and computationally sophisticated introduction to genetics, developmental biology, genomics, evolution and population genetics. This is the first course in the year-long multidisciplinary integrated science sequence. Multiple faculty will be involved over the year, including P. Andolfatto (EEB), M. Murthy (MOL), J. Rabinowitz (CHM), M. Singh (COS), E. Wieschaus (MOL).  2 hrs and 40 min of lecture, one precept (1 hr 50 min), one evening problem session.
COS323 | Computing and Optimization | http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=012833&term=1152 | instructors:Amir Ali Ahmadi description:An introduction to several fundamental and practically-relevant areas of numerical computing with an emphasis on the role of modern optimization. Topics include computational linear algebra, descent methods, basics of linear and semidefinite programming, optimization for statistical regression and classification, trajectory optimization for dynamical systems, and techniques for dealing with uncertainty and intractability in optimization problems. Extensive hands-on experience with high-level optimization software. Applications drawn from operations research, statistics, finance, economics, control theory, and engineering.
COS455 | Genomics  Computational Mol Bio | http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=010185&term=1152 | instructors:Anastasia Baryshnikova description:The course will provide a detailed overview of experimental and computational approaches used to study molecular systesm.  We will focus on modern technologies used to generate and alanlyze "omics" data, such as genome sequences, gene expression, transcriptional and post-transcriptional modification, proteomics and mass spectrometry, molecular interaction networks and chemical genomics.  We will also discuss and apply fundamental statistical concepts relevant to genomics (data evaluation,estimation of true and false positives, significance testing, multiple testing correction) and learn basic programming tools.
