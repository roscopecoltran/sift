ep245 | How to Build a Startup - Business Model Canvas | https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245 | available:yes level:intermediate instructors:Steve Blank project:Business Model Canvas  description:In an introduction to the basics of the famous Customer Development Process, Steve Blank provides insight into the key steps needed to build a successful startup. The main idea in this course is learning how to rapidly develop and test ideas by gathering massive amounts of customer and marketplace feedback. Many startups fail by not validating their ideas early on with real-life customers.

Only with these can the entrepreneur find a proper solution and establish a suitable business model.Building a startup is not simply building an execution plan for a business model that the entrepreneur thinks will work, but rather, a search for the actual business model itself.
