MATH300 | Math for Teaching Arithmetic | http://www.math.harvard.edu/~engelwar/MathE300/ | instructors:Andrew Engelward http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/andrew-engelward description:Why do students have such a difficult time with arithmetic? It could be because arithmetic is much more complex than we initially suspect. For instance, the symbol Â½ has at least four different interpretations. When a student encounters this fraction he or she must decide which interpretation will best help solve the problem. In this course, we study why it makes sense to do arithmetic the way we do. Moreover, we see how amazing our number system actually is. (Students should try multiplying 97 by 56 using only Roman numerals if they are skeptical.) This course emphasizes mathematical reasoning rather than mathematical skills and results, and communication is a large part of the course. In addition to the mathematical content, we also discuss how different methods of teaching affect students differently.  (4 credits) 
MATH302 | Math for Teaching Geometry | http://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/1509 | instructors:Andrew Engelward http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/andrew-engelward description:Geometry is all about symmetry, shape, and space. We begin our exploration by going back to the classic work on geometry, Euclid's The Elements; studying straightedge and compass constructions; and then working our way to more modern topics such as tessellations and Pick's theorem. Along the way we also investigate golden rectangles, constructible numbers, and geometry in higher dimensions. We emphasize mathematical reasoning, and communicating mathematics plays an important role in the course. (4 credits)

What does it mean to prove a theorem and how do people discover or create these proofs? In this course, we begin with basic tools of deduction and reason our way together until we reach new and interesting conclusions. Along the way we see some beautiful results about the building blocks of mathematics: numbers, sets, shapes, and other mathematical structures. The class is interactive. (4 credits) 
MATH320 | Teaching Mathematics with a Historical Perspective | http://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/1775 | instructors:Oliver Knill http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/oliver-knill description:The difficulty of both learning and teaching math is evident in its history. The struggle of early research mathematicians who developed and formalized a topic parallels the struggle of students and teachers in the modern classroom. Students learning about the concept of limits and series undergo a similar process as the pioneers of calculus did when they developed the subject. Archimedes, Zeno, Cavalieri, Newton, Leibniz, and Cauchy had to find or invent structure. This struggle goes on today, as new flavors of calculus are developed and studied. Each week, this course considers a different math subject and pinpoints a moment when something interesting happened. This moment is condensed into a specific and concrete mathematical problem. Each story is tied to a particular mathematician. (4 credits)

Schwartz http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/judah-l-schwartz description:This course is designed to expand teachers' mathematical habits of mind and to help teachers think more deeply about aspects of mathematics that they know, are expected to teach, and that their students are expected to learn.

MATH599 | Teaching Projects: Math for Teaching Capstone Course | http://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/1510 | instructors:Andrew Engelward http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/andrew-engelward description:This course is intended to give current and aspiring secondary math teachers an opportunity to become engaged in a variety of teaching-related projects. In the first part of the course, participants are given a chance to research a current topic in mathematics education through use of journal articles, giving a presentation of their findings to the math for teaching community. In the second part, participants are asked to investigate how use of a particular technology can be used to enhance classroom math lessons. In addition, everyone gets a chance to participate in an alternative math teaching experiment. (4 credits)
