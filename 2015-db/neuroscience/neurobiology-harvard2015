EXAM GROUP:   Fall: 17; Spring: 13 description:Students will examine primary literature to understand the acute and chronic action of drugs of abuse, including opioids, cannabinoids, psychostimulants, nicotine, and ethanol. The course will introduce the models of addiction and examine animal and human research results to build an understanding of how modifications to molecular signaling, cells and neural circuits underlie the development of the addicted brain. 
Neurobiology101hfj | Brain Rhythms in Cognition, Mental Health & Epilepsy | http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/94358 | instructors: Members of the Department prereq:LS 1a, MCB 80, and permission of the instructor term:Half course (throughout the year). W., 7–8:30 p.m. EXAM GROUP:   Fall: 17; Spring: 13 description:"Everything in the universe has a rhythm, everything dances." - Maya Angelou. The brain, too, dances. Its rhythms are the result of millions of neurons coordinating each other’s activity. This course will explore how these rhythms are generated, how they relate to our perception and cognition, and how they can be used to better understand and diagnose psychiatric and neurological disorders. 
Neurobiology101hfl | Building Blocks of Neural Networks: Synapses and Circuits in Heath and Psychiatric Disease  - (New Course)  | http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/85872 | instructors: Members of the Department prereq:LS 1a, MCB 80, and permission of the instructor term:Half course (throughout the year). Th., 7–8:30 p.m. EXAM GROUP:   Fall: 16; Spring: 6 description:The synapse is a fundamental information-processing unit of the nervous system. In this course, we will first explore the biology of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, developmental origins of neuronal subtypes and mechanisms that govern their circuit integration. Then we will address the basic design principles, wiring and functional plasticity of neuronal circuits that are altered in a plethora of neuropsychiatric disorders. We will also discuss how this knowledge can be used to better understand, diagnose and design therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders. 
Neurobiology101hfm | Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience  - (New Course)  | http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/62858 | instructors: Members of the Department prereq:LS 1a, MCB 80, one of Math 19a/21a/21b or above, or permission of the instructor. term:Half course (throughout the year). Tu., 7–8:30 p.m. EXAM GROUP:   Fall: 16; Spring: 6 description:The brain is an extremely complex computing device. Computational neuroscience seeks to understand brain function by constructing mathematical models of the nervous system to summarize our knowledge and gain new insights into how neurons perform basic tasks, e.g., encode stimuli, form memories, or generate movements. This course presents computational techniques for investigating, modeling, and understanding the function of neurons, neuronal networks, and systems.
