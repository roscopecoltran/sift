PS10 | Quantum and Statistical Foundations of Chemistry | http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/75544 | instructors: Adam E. Cohen prereq:A strong background in chemistry (Chemistry AP score of 5, or Physical Sciences 1, or equivalent preparation), mathematics at the level of Mathematics 1b (may be taken concurrently), and some familiarity with physics (force, energy, work, and electric charge). term:Half course (fall term). M., W., F., at 10 and a weekly section and lab to be arranged. EXAM GROUP:   5 description:This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe. 
PSnces hold the key to solving unprecedented problems at the intersection of science, technology, and an array of rapidly emerging global scale challenges | The course emphasizes a molecular scale understanding of energy and entropy; free energy in equilibria, acid/base reactivity, and electrochemistry; molecular bonding and kinetics; catalysis in organic and inorganic systems; the union of quantum mechanics, nanostructures, and photovoltaics; and the analysis of nuclear energy. Case studies are used both to develop quantitative reasoning and to directly link these principles to global strategies. | http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/24022 | instructors: James G. Anderson and Gregory C. Tucci prereq:A few operations of calculus are developed and used. Fluency in pre-calculus secondary school mathematics is assumed. Students are expected to have high school chemistry, or have completed Life and Physical Sciences A (LPS A) or Life Sciences 1a (LS 1a), or permission of the instructors. term:Half course (spring term). M., W., F., at 10 and a weekly section and lab to be arranged. EXAM GROUP:   5 description:This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe.  NOTE:  Physical Sciences 1 and Physical Sciences 11 cannot both be taken for credit.
