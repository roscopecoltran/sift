APAC seeks to apply recent research breakthroughs in this field in an attempt to scale DoD's program analysis capability to a level never before achieved with an automated solution. 
darpa-open-project-4 | AVMNEW | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=darpa-open-project-4 AVMNEW | description:TTO The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) portfolio of programs had a goal of compressing the development timelines for new complex cyber-physical systems by at least five-fold. With AVM, DARPA pursued the development of several elements of enabling infrastructure aimed at radically transforming the systems engineering / design / verification (META), manufacturing (iFAB), and collaborative innovation (VehicleFORGE) elements of the overall "make" process for modern defense systems. Each of these infrastructure capabilities was largely generic and applicable to any cyber-physical or cyber-electro-mechanical system. This approach was highly dependent on the generation of high-fidelity component, context and manufacturing process models. In order to exercise these capabilities in the context of a relevant military system, AVM also included FANG--the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Vehicle--a design and development effort for a new amphibious infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) that was implemented for the purpose of demonstrating the efficacy of AVM tools and processes. The AVM portfolio began a transition to the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute in 2014.

darpa-open-project-20 | MEMEX | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=darpa-open-project-20 MEMEX | description:I2O Today's web searches use a centralized, one-size-fits-all approach that searches the Internet with the same set of tools for all queries. While that model has been wildly successful commercially, it does not work well for many government use cases. To help overcome these challenges, DARPA launched the Memex program in September 2014. Memex seeks to develop software that advances online search capabilities far beyond the current state of the art. The goal is to invent better methods for interacting with and sharing information, so users can quickly and thoroughly organize and search subsets of information relevant to their individual interests. Creation of a new domain-specific indexing and search paradigm will provide mechanisms for improved content discovery, information extraction, information retrieval, user collaboration, and extension of current search capabilities to the deep web, the dark web, and nontraditional (e.g. multimedia) content.

Email spam filters, smartphone personal assistants and self-driving vehicles are all based on research advances in machine learning. Unfortunately, even as the demand for these capabilities is accelerating, every new application requires a Herculean effort. Teams of hard-to-find experts must build expensive, custom tools that are often painfully slow and can perform unpredictably against large, complex data sets.The Probabilistic Programming for Advancing Machine Learning (PPAML) program aims to address these challenges. Probabilistic programming is a new programming paradigm for managing uncertain information. Using probabilistic programming languages, PPAML seeks to greatly increase the number of people who can successfully build machine learning applications and make machine learning experts radically more effective. Moreover, the program seeks to create more economical, robust and powerful applications that need less data to produce more accurate results - features inconceivable with today's technology.
