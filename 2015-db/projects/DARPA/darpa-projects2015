darpa-project-5 | A2P | http://www.darpa.mil/program/atoms-to-product | description:The goal of the Atoms to Product (A2P) program is to develop the technologies and processes required to assemble nanometer-scale pieces, whose dimensions are near the size of atoms, into systems, components, or materials that are at least millimeter-scale in size. Many common materials exhibit unique and very uncommon physical characteristics when fabricated at nanometer-scale. These “atomic-scale” behaviors have potentially important defense applications, including quantized current-voltage behavior, dramatically lower melting points and significantly higher specific heats, for example. The challenge is how to retain the characteristics of materials at the atomic scale in much larger “product-scale” (typically a few centimeters) devices and systems.  More
darpa-project-6 | AAA | http://www.darpa.mil/program/assured-arctic-awareness | description:The Arctic region is poised for greater regional significance as polar ice retreats in coming decades. Ship traffic likely will increase during summer months, and commercial activity focused on the sea floor is expected to grow. The Arctic is largely isolated, vast, and environmentally extreme. Remote sensing may offer affordable advantages over traditional methods of monitoring the region—aircraft, satellites or manned ships and submarines—due to the great distances in the Arctic. More
darpa-project-7 | ACD | http://www.darpa.mil/program/active-cyber-defense | description:U.S. military, government and commercial IT networks face constant cyberattack from both criminal and state-sponsored adversaries. Current IT security response practices to these attacks boil down to four steps: find the invading code, unplug the affected systems, create security patches to thwart particular attacks, and apply those patches network-wide. This reactive engagement model is effective on a case-by-case basis but does not address key advantages attackers have—for example, adversaries can easily make small changes to malware that bypass patches and distribute that new malware on a massive scale.

darpa-project-11 | Active Authentication | http://www.darpa.mil/program/active-authentication | description:The current standard method for validating a user’s identity for authentication on an information system requires humans to do something that is inherently unnatural: create, remember, and manage long, complex passwords.  Moreover, as long as the session remains active, typical systems incorporate no mechanisms to verify that the user originally authenticated is the user still in control of the keyboard.  Thus unauthorized individuals may improperly obtain extended access to information system resources if a password is compromised or if a user does not exercise adequate vigilance after initially authenticating at the console.

darpa-project-17 | ANS | http://www.darpa.mil/program/adaptable-navigation-systems | description:The military relies heavily on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), but GPS access is easily blocked by methods such as jamming.  In addition, many environments in which our military operates (inside buildings, in urban canyons, under dense foliage, underwater, and underground) have limited or no GPS access.  To solve this challenge, Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) seeks to provide GPS-quality PNT to military users regardless of the operational environment.  More

darpa-project-25 | Battlefield Medicine | http://www.darpa.mil/program/battlefield-medicine | description:Battlefield logistics are a challenge regardless of the mission. Adversaries, terrain, and the environment can all serve to complicate the process of delivering supplies to warfighters. The current Department of Defense (DoD) approach to medical supply logistics is limited in its reach to far-forward emergency settings, response to emergent in-theater threats, and utility for bio-preparedness stockpiling. It can often take weeks to months to manufacture and airlift organic pharmaceuticals and protein therapeutics to battlefield frontlines, meaning that critical medical supplies often do not arrive in time where they are needed most.

For the purposes of the CwC program, communication is understood to be the sharing of complex ideas in collaborative contexts. Complex ideas are assumed to be built from a relatively small set of elementary ideas, and language is thought to specify such complex ideas—but not completely, because language is ambiguous and depends in part on context, which can augment language and improve the specification of complex ideas. Thus, the CwC program will focus on developing technology for assembling complex ideas from elementary ones given language and context.  More

darpa-project-69 | GRAPHS | http://www.darpa.mil/program/graphs | description:The science of network analysis is in its infancy. Currently, the structure of real-world networks is described only in terms of coarse and basic details such as diameter, degree distribution, etc.  In addition, as networks become large, many problems are intractable as the classical algorithms for these problems run in exponential time with respect to the size of the graph. A large number of important problems (e.g., structural and functional brain dynamics or gene-protein and disease networks) can be formulated as graph problems. A comprehensive mathematical understanding of large networks is needed in order to effectively apply and scale graph-based network analysis techniques for use in DoD-relevant scenarios. More
darpa-project-70 | HACMS | http://www.darpa.mil/program/high-assurance-cyber-military-systems | description:Embedded systems form a ubiquitous, networked, computing substrate that underlies much of modern technological society. Such systems range from large supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that manage physical infrastructure to medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, to computer peripherals such as printers and routers, to communication devices such as cell phones and radios, to vehicles such as airplanes and satellites. Such devices have been networked for a variety of reasons, including the ability to conveniently access diagnostic information, perform software updates, provide innovative features, lower costs, and improve ease of use. Researchers and hackers have shown that these kinds of networked embedded systems are vulnerable to remote attack, and such attacks can cause physical damage while hiding the effects from monitors.

High performance SoC designs have been made feasible by the increased speed and higher density available in modern nanometer-scale integrated circuit processes.  However, a major consequence of the drive toward ever smaller transistor gate lengths is an exponential increase in intrawafer and intradie process variations that degrade on circuit performance.  Consequently, designers must over-constrain performance order to guarantee sufficient postfabrication performance yield. More

darpa-project-140 | RAM | http://www.darpa.mil/program/restoring-active-memory | description:Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious cause of disability in the United States. Diagnosed in more than 270,000 military servicemembers since 2000 and affecting an estimated 1.7 million U.S. civilians each year1, TBI frequently results in an impaired ability to retrieve memories formed prior to injury and a reduced capacity to form or retain new memories following injury. Despite the scale of the problem, few effective therapies currently exist to mitigate the long-term consequences of TBI on memory. Through the Restoring Active Memory (RAM) program, DARPA seeks to accelerate the development of technology able to address this public health challenge and help servicemembers and others overcome memory deficits by developing new neuroprosthetics to bridge gaps in the injured brain.

An attacker generally requires no more than a basic debugger, a compiler and about a day's effort to de-obfuscate code that has been obfuscated with the best current methods. The reason for the relative ease is that program obfuscation is primarily based on "security through obscurity" strategies, typified by inserting passive junk code into a program’s source code. Existing program obfuscation methods also do not have quantifiable security models, and so it is difficult even to measure how much security is gained by a given obfuscation effort. More

Because their military training, however, focuses primarily on kinetic operations, many servicemembers, especially those junior in age and experience, find these roles unfamiliar and challenging. Most existing training for non-kinetic operations is limited in time and scope and typically emphasizes general familiarization with language and culture, rather than building fundamental skills that enable such specific knowledge to be implemented successfully. While some highly effective military training programs focus on enhancing servicemembers’ capacity to function in non-kinetic social encounters, they tend to be extremely costly and manpower intensive.

These frequent and varying transient loads are often transmitted to occupants, which can degrade warfighters’ performance by creating discomfort and injuries. In addition, varying loads can lead to shortened service life for the military platforms, as well as the equipment inside. Currently, structures designed to achieve high stiffness for static loads (dead weight) typically can’t adapt to or dampen dynamic loads well. Conversely, structures designed for high damping do not carry conventional loads as efficiently.  More
