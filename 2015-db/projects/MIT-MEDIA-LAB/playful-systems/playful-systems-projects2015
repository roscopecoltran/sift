mit-media-playful-systems-1 | Tools for Super-Human Time Perception | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=mit-media-playful-systems-1 Tools for Super-Human Time Perception | description:Kevin Slavin and Che-Wei Wang Time perception is a fundamental component in our ability to build mental models of our world. Without accurate and precise time perception, we might have trouble understanding speech, fumble social interactions, have poor motor control, hallucinate, or remember events incorrectly. Slight distortions in time perception are commonplace and may lead to slight dyslexia, memory shifts, poor eye-hand coordination and other relatively benign symptoms, but could a diminishing sense of time signal the onset of a serious brain disorder? Could time perception training help prevent or reverse brain disorders? This project is a series of experimental tools built to assist and increase human time perception. By approaching time-perception training from various perspectives, we hope to find a tool or collection of tools to increase time perception, and in turn discover what an increase in time perception might afford us.

This is too fast for a human to perceive, and even more difficult to imagine its interaction with the mechanical circulation of a clock. 32,768 Times Per Second is a diagrammatic, procedural, and fully functional sculpture of the electro-mechanical landscape inside a common wristwatch. Through a series of electronic transformations, the signal from a crystal is broken down over and over, and then built back up to the human sense of time.

mit-media-playful-systems-7 | Case and Molly | https://www.google.com.hk/?gws_rd=cr,ssl#safe=strict&q=mit-media-playful-systems-7 Case and Molly | description:Gregory Borenstein Case and Molly is a prototype for a game inspired by (and in homage to) William Gibson's novel Neuromancer. It's about the coordination between virtual and physical, "cyberspace" and "meat." We navigate the tension between our physical surroundings and our digital networks in a state of continuous partial attention; Case and Molly uses the mechanics and aesthetics of Neuromancer to explore this quintessential contemporary dynamic. The game is played by two people mediated by smartphones and an Oculus Rift VR headset. Together, and under time pressure, they must navigate Molly through physical space using information that is only available to Case. In the game, Case sees Molly's point of view in immersive 3D, but he can only communicate a single bit of information to her. Meanwhile, Molly traverses physical obstacles hoping Case can solve abstract puzzles in order to gain access to the information she needs.

Every day, the game starts abruptly–synchronizing all players at once–and lasts for two minutes. In 60 seconds, players must choose either to help form the front line of a quarantine, or remain passive. Under pressure, the "uninfected" attempt to collaborate without communication, seeking to find the best solution for the group. When those 60 seconds end, a certain number of players are trapped inside with patient zero, and the score reflects the group's ability to cooperate under duress.

It is fast-paced, dynamic, and deeply psychological. Unfortunately, most of the game's drama is only visible to spectators who are themselves expert chess players. DeepView seeks to use computational tools to make the drama of high-level chess accessible to novice viewers. There is a long tradition of software trying to beat human players at chess; DeepView takes advantage of algorithmic tools created in the development of advanced chess engines such as Deep Blue, but instead uses them to understand and explain the styles of individual players and the dynamics of a given match. It puts into the hands of chess commentators powerful data science tools that can calculate player position preferences and likely game outcomes, helping commentators to better explain the exciting human story inside every match.
mit-media-playful-systems-11 | Designing Immersive Multi-Sensory Eating Experiences | http://media.mit.edu/~janiwang | description:Kevin Slavin and Janice Wang Food offers a rich multi-modal experience that can deeply affect emotion and memory. We're interested in exploring the artistic and expressive potential of food beyond mere nourishment, as a means of creating memorable experiences that involve multiple senses. For instance, music can change our eating experience by altering our emotions during the meal, or by evoking a specific time and place. Similarly, sight, smell, and temperature can all be manipulated to combine with food for expressive effect. In addition, by drawing upon people's physiology and upbringing, we seek to create individual, meaningful sensory experiences. Specifically, we are exploring the connection between music and flavor perception. view site

Modern-day computer games utilize weighted probabilities to make games more competitive, fun, and addicting. In casinos, slot machines–once a product of simple probability–employ similar algorithms to keep players playing. Dice++ takes the seemingly straight probability of rolling a die and determines an outcome with algorithms of its own. view site

To date, it has attracted an online community of over 50,000 "citizen neuroscientists" who are mapping the 3D structure of neurons and discovering neural connections. Playful Systems is collaborating with the Seung Lab to reconsider EyeWire as a large scale mass-appeal mobile game to attract 1MM players or more. We are currently developing mobile, collaborative game mechanics, and shifting the focus to short-burst gameplay.

This synthetic organism–built from interconnected microbiological systems–will be sustained in part through its own feedback and feedforward loops, but also through interactions with the architectural systems (like HVAC). As the different systems react and exchange material inputs and outputs, they move towards homeostasis. In the process, Homeostasis creates a new landscape of the human body, in which we can experience the wonder and vulnerability of its interconnected systems.
mit-media-playful-systems-15 | MicroPsi: An Architecture for Motivated Cognition | http://micropsi.com | description:Joscha Bach The MicroPsi project explores broad models of cognition, built on a motivational system that gives rise to autonomous social and cognitive behaviors. MicroPsi agents are grounded AI agents, with neuro-symbolic representations, affect, top-down/bottom-up perception, and autonomous decision making. We are interested in finding out how motivation informs social interaction (cooperation and competition, communication and deception), learning, and playing; shapes personality; and influences perception and creative problem-solving. view site

mit-media-playful-systems-17 | Sneak: A Hybrid Digital-Physical Tabletop Game | http://cardboardmagic.tumblr.com | description:Greg Borenstein and Kevin Slavin Sneak is a hybrid digital tabletop game for two-to-four players about deception, stealth, and social intuition. Each player secretly controls one agent in a procedurally generated supervillain lair. Their mission is to find the secret plans and escape without getting discovered, shot, or poisoned by another player. To accomplish this, players must interact and blend in with a series of computer-controlled henchmen while keeping a close eye on their human opponents for any social cues that might reveal their identity. Sneak introduces a number of systems which are common in video games, but were impractical in tabletop games that did not deeply integrate a smartphone app. These include procedural map generation, NPC pathfinding, dynamic game balancing, and the use of sound. view site

Though hidden, these systems condition our bodies, environment, and even sensibilities and desires. The proposed works introduce a model of interaction in which the microbiome is an extension of the human sensory system, accessed through a series of biological interfaces that enable exchange. Biological Interfaces transfer discrete behaviors of microbes into information across scales, where it may be manipulated, even if unseen. In the same way the field of HCI has articulated our exchanges with electronic signals, Soft Exchange opens up the question of how to design for this other invisible, though present, and vital material.
