W., 9:30–12. EXAM GROUP:   12 description:This course is all about Statistical Learning techniques in Psychology and related fields. Statistical Learning is a modern discipline of Statistics which involves developments from the fields of Statistics (obviously), Machine Learning, Computer and Data Science. Overall it refers to a vast set of tools for understanding complex data. The first series of lectures covers basic regression techniques for categorical data (ordinal and multinomial logit models) as well as advanced techniques such as causal models (propensity score matching), spatial regression, censored regression (tobit), nonlinear regression (generalized additive models), regularization and shrinkage methods (Ridge, LASSO), and generalized estimation equation (GEE) for longitudinal/correlational data. Another lecture series deals with clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, BIRCH, and mixture models (e.g. latent class analysis). The mixture model approach will then be embedded into a regression context in order to estimate regression models with unobserved heterogeneity (latent class regression). Finally, there will be a unit on functional data analysis (FDA) where each single observation is described by a function (e.g. eye tracking data, brain imaging data).
