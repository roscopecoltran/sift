DBIO211 | Biophysics of Multi-cellular Systems and Amorphous Computing (BIOE 211, BIOE 311, BIOPHYS 311) | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=DBIO211 | instructors: description:Provides an interdisciplinary perspective on the design, emergent behavior, and functionality of multi-cellular biological systems such as embryos, biofilms, and artificial tissues and their conceptual relationship to amorphous computers. Students discuss relevant literature and introduced to and apply pertinent mathematical and biophysical modeling approaches to various aspect multi-cellular systems, furthermore carry out real biology experiments over the web. Specific topics include: (Morphogen) gradients; reaction-diffusion systems (Turing patterns); visco-elastic aspects and forces in tissues; morphogenesis; coordinated gene expression, genetic oscillators and synchrony; genetic networks; self-organization, noise, robustness, and evolvability; game theory; emergent behavior; criticality; symmetries; scaling; fractals; agent based modeling. The course is geared towards a broadly interested graduate and advanced undergraduates audience such as from bio / applied physics, computer science, developmental and systems biology, and bio / tissue / mechanical / electrical engineering. Prerequisites: Previous knowledge in one programming language - ideally Matlab - is recommended; undergraduate students benefit from BIOE 41, BIOE 42, or equivalent.
DBIO215 | Frontiers in Biological Research (BIOC 215, GENE 215) | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=DBIO215 | instructors:Harbury, P. (PI); Pringle, J. (PI); Villeneuve, A. (PI) description:Students analyze cutting edge science, develop a logical framework for evaluating evidence and models, and enhance their ability to design original research through exposure to experimental tools and strategies.  The class runs in parallel with the Frontiers in Biological Research seminar series.  Students and faculty meet on the Tuesday preceding each seminar to discuss a landmark paper in the speaker's field of research.  Following the Wednesday seminar, students meet briefly with the speaker for a free-range discussion which can include insights into the speakers' paths into science and how they pick scientific problems.
DBIO234 | Elements of Grant Writing | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=DBIO234 | instructors:Kim, S. (PI) description:Focus is on training first year graduate students in proposal writing. In an intensive 4-week period, students learn fundamental skills focused on scientific proposal writing, including writing and criticizing a proposal on the scientific topic of their choice. Students encouraged to use these new skills and the proposal they create to apply for external funding to support their research training.
