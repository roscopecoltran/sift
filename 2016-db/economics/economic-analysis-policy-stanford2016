MGTECON200 | Managerial Economics | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=MGTECON200 | instructors:Kreps, D. (PI); Williams, J. (GP) description:MGTECON 200 is one of two base-level courses in microeconomics. It covers microeconomic concepts relevant to management, including the economics of relationships, pricing decisions, perfect competition and the "invisible hand," risk aversion and risk sharing, and moral hazard and adverse selection. While the topics covered and the level of coverage are the same as in the second base-level course, MGTECON 201, MGTECON 200 is administered and graded differently: Attendance is mandatory, and 50% of the final grade is based on daily class participation. Because of the emphasis on class participation, class sessions are 105 minutes long and so, per Stanford University regulations, the course carries four units of credit.
MGTECON201 | Managerial Economics | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=MGTECON201 | instructors:Sugaya, T. (PI); Smith, J. (GP) description:MGTECON 201 is one of two base-level courses in microeconomics. It covers microeconomic concepts relevant to management, including the economics of relationships, pricing decisions, perfect competition and the "invisible hand," risk aversion and risk sharing, and moral hazard and adverse selection. While the topics covered and the level of coverage are the same as in the second base-level course, MGTECON 200, MGTECON 201 is administered and graded differently: 15% of the final grade is based on participation (you can miss the class without affecting the grade up to 3 times), 35% is on the midterm, and 50% is on the final.
MGTECON203 | Managerial Economics - Accelerated | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=MGTECON203 | instructors:Lambert, N. (PI); Bligh, S. (GP) description:MGTECON 203 is the accelerated option in microeconomics for 1st year MBA students. It will cover the usual array of topics, with an emphasis on topics more useful for students of management (although the order in which the topics are covered will be different from that in 200/201). No previous background in economics is required or expected, but in comparison with MGTECON 200/201, less time will be spent in class on basic problems. Therefore, students choosing this option should be completely comfortable with calculus and linear algebra. A good diagnostic is to read Sections 3.5 and 3.6 (pp. 57-67) in Kreps, Microeconomics for Managers. If you find this easy, 203 is a good choice. If not, 200 or 201 is the right course for you.
MGTECON249 | Smart Pricing and Market Design | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=MGTECON249 | instructors:Ostrovsky, M. (PI); Bligh, S. (GP) description:This is the Advanced Applications option in the menu of courses that satisfy the Management Perspectives requirement in Optimization and Simulation Modeling (OSM). The course is tailored to students who already have command of basic optimization and simulation techniques, or have an advanced mathematical background that will allow them to catch up quickly. The focus of the course is on applying these techniques to a particular business domain: pricing mechanisms and market design. The pricing component of the course will handle both traditional topics, such as price differentiation, and more modern ones, such as dynamic pricing. In the market design component of the course, we will apply optimization and simulation techniques to such topics as auctions (e.g., designing auctions for selling online advertising slots) and matching (e.g., designing mechanisms for matching students to schools). No background in economics or in the pricing and market design topics mentioned above is required or expected.

(SI) description:This course was originally designed to provide an overview of the crisis in financial markets that began in 2007, and of the various policies that were devised in response to the crisis' both short-term stabilization efforts and longer-term regulatory reform. However, as time goes on the course has evolved to spend less time on a historical review of those past events (though they are still significant and worth studying) and more time looking at the present and the future. We will be more focused on process --- thinking through the things we analyze --- rather than in making sure we cover a fully comprehensive set of topics. We have guest speakers for about half of the classes. The list changes from year to year, but here is 2016's list: Tanya Beder, Kevin Warsh, Ron Beck, David Booth, Jay Crandall, Tom Kempner, Katie Hall, Hal Varian, and Larry Summers.

(SI) description:This class will analyze the growth in inequality in the US over the last several decades and how that trend is likely to continue or change in the future. We will ask if and how public policy can affect inequality. We will also focus on business's role -- what are the responsibilities of private sector companies, how does inequality affect them, and how should the growth in inequality affect their strategies? We will look at inequality in income, some of its potential sources, and its effects in other areas. Specifically, we will look at education, housing, the social safety net, migration, and the job market. The class will be very interactive and will be based on readings drawn from academic research, case studies, news, and opinion readings. We will also have guest speakers from industry, government, and non-profits. The class will be co-taught by a GSB labor economist and an advisor to policy makers with decades of business experience (see http://www.ppic.org/main/bio2.asp?i=431).

(GP) description:The course will review the results from a large management practices project involving Cambridge, Harvard, the London School of Economics, McKinsey & Company and Stanford. McKinsey have developed a basic management practice evaluation tool - detailing about 20 key practices - which has been used to evaluate about 20,000 organizations in manufacturing, retail, healthcare and education across North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia. These data provide a global insight into the basic management practices around monitoring, targets and talent management that firms adopt around the world. We will examine the link between management and performance, and the reasons for differences in management across firms, industries and countries. This will be supplemented with the results from more recent research with Accenture and the World Bank in India on change management interventions in a developing country context.n nThe course will focus on making students familiar with this research and in particular the scoring grid so that they can easily performance an initial overview of the management practices of any organization. For example, this would be ideal for an initial evaluation of the management practices in a target company for private equity investment or a preliminary evaluation ("diagnostic") of a potential client by a consulting firm.
