A major goal is to lay out a coherent argument that, for all its theoretical innovation, The General Theory did not deliver: the argument why a market system, even an idealized system with all of the warts removed, may fail to provide jobs for willing workers. In the process we will examine the orthodoxy that Keynes attacked and that resurfaced in the 1960s and 70s; the key concepts underlying the models implicit in The General Theory; and the attempts of the Keynesian mainstream to make peace with both Keynes and orthodoxy. We will also explore the applicability of The General Theory to the long run. A final section will view the present economic difficulties through a Keynesian lens.

Economics2035 | Psychology and Economic Theory  - (New Course)  | http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/42326 | instructors: Matthew Rabin term:Half course (fall term). M., 1–4. EXAM GROUP:   1 description:This course explores ways that psychological research indicating systematic departures from classical economic assumptions can be translated into formal models that can be incorporated into economics. Topics include ways utility theory can be improved--such as incorporating reference dependence, news utility, social preferences, self image, and other belief-based tastes--and ways we can relax assumptions of perfect rationality--such as incorporating focusing effects, limited attention,  biased prediction of future tastes, present-biased preferences, biases in probabilistic judgment, and errors in social inference. The course will emphasize (a) careful interpretation and production of new evidence on relevant departures,(b) formalizing this evidence into models that can, with discipline and rigor, generate sharp predictions using traditional economic approaches, and (c) exploring economic implications of those models presented. Although we will primarily emphasize (b), the course is meant to be useful to students whose interests lie anywhere in this spectrum, under the premise that all such research will be improved by a greater appreciation of the full spectrum. The course is intended for PhD students in the Business Economics and Economics programs and others who have a solid background in microeconomic theory at the level of introductory PhD courses in these programs. While obviously appropriate to those wishing to specialize in "behavioral economics", the course is also designed for those interested in doing research in particular fields of economics. And while the course centers on theoretical models (learning and evaluation will center around solving formal problem sets), the theory is focused towards its empirical implementability and economic relevance, so that the course is also designed for those interested in theory-influenced empirical research.

EXAM GROUP:   1 description:Innovations in machine learning (’big data’) have created many engineering breakthroughs from real time voice recognition to automatic categorization (and in some cases production) of news stories.  Since these techniques are at their essence novel ways to work with data, they should also have implications for social science. This course explores the intersection of machine learning and social science and aims to answer a few questions about these new techniques: (i) How do they work and what kinds of statistical guarantees can be made about their performance? (ii) How can they be used to answer questions that interest social science researchers, such as testing theories or improving social policy; and (iii) How might they open up new research questions? We will cover standard machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, statistical learning theory and nonparametric and Bayesian approaches.  The goal is to create a working understanding of when and how they can be profitably applied. Students will be required to apply some of these techniques themselves, but we will not cover the computational aspects of the underlying methods.  The course is aimed at PhD students with a solid background in statistical techniques, such as comes from the equivalent of a first year economics PhD econometrics sequence.
