There are many similarities in the goals and strategies of biological and computational systems which suggest that each can learn from the other. These include the distributed nature of the networks (in biology molecules, cells, or organisms often operate without central control), the ability to successfully handle failures and attacks on a subset of the nodes, modularity and the ability to reuse certain components or sub-networks in multiple applications and the use of stochasticity in biology and randomized algorithms in computer science. In this course we will start by discussing classic biologically motivated algorithms including neural networks (inspired by the brain), genetic algorithms (sequence evolution), non-negative matrix factorization (signal processing in the brain), and search optimization (ant colony formation). We will then continue to discuss more recent bi-directional studies that have relied on biological processes to solve routing and synchronization problems, discover Maximal Independent Sets (MIS), and design robust and fault tolerant networks. In the second part of the class students will read and present new research in this area. Students will also work in groups on a final project in which they develop and test a new biologically inspired algorithm.

However, as MS has turned quantitative, more sophisticated experiments can be performed, such as the recording of signal transduction kinetics and the analysis of the composition of protein complexes and organelles.  This makes MS-based proteomics a powerful method to study spatiotemporal protein dynamics. The development of relative quantification approaches, which generally use 2H, 13C or 15N isotope labels, has especially led to an increase in quantification accuracy and set off numerous new experimental approaches to study protein regulation.In this mini-course, we will cover mass spectrometry principles, discuss classical as well as current primary literature addressing method development and quantitative analysis, and highlight state-of-the-art biological studies that employ MS. A combination of lectures, student presentations, and written exercises will establish a thorough knowledge of current bio-analytical MS approaches.

Students will learn about business modeling, customer development, customer  validation, proposal, product branding, and marketing for their product. The  course will require students to spend most time to validate their start up  concept and prototypes with potential customers and adapt to critical  feedback and revise their respective value propositions accordingly.  Students learn to balance technical product development with customer  requirements, business strategy and budget constraints. This course provides  real world, hands-on learning on what it is like to start a company.  Different business modeling will be covered. By understand customer  discovery and validation concepts will aid students to effectively modify  their original concepts to meet market demands. Student teams will learn how  to revise, improve their prototype by the end of the term. This is a fast  paced course in which students are expected to spend most of the time  outside of the classroom to interact with potential customers to validate,  test, verify, and integrate essentials elements for their start-up business  proposal. Up to now, students have been learning some technologies and  methods for solving problems in the life science industry and build a  prototype for their start-up. However, a new venture proposal is not a  collection of isolated bits. It should be thorough validated via customer's  inputs and market needs to tell a single story of how the venture will reach  its end goals. Final deliverable is creation and presentation of a well  explicated, business proposal in addition to a product prototype  corresponding to the business proposal.

CB02750 | Automation of Biological Research: Robotics and Machine Learning | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=02750&SEMESTER=F15 | instructors:Langmead, Christopher description:Biology is increasingly becoming a "big data" science, as biomedical research has been revolutionized by automated methods for generating large amounts of data on diverse biological processes. Integration of data from many types of experiments is required to construct detailed, predictive models of cell, tissue or organism behaviors, and the complexity of the systems suggests that these models need to be constructed automatically. This requires iterative cycles of acquisition, analysis, modeling, and experimental design, since it is not feasible to do all possible biological experiments. This course will cover a range of automated biological research methods and a range of computational methods for automating the acquisition and interpretation of the data (especially active learning, proactive learning, compressed sensing and model structure learning). Grading will be based on class participation, homeworks, and a final project. The course is designed for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students with a wide variety of backgrounds. The course is intended to be self-contained but students may need to do some additional work to gain fluency in core concepts. Students should have a basic knowledge of biology, statistics, and programming. Experience with Machine Learning is useful but not mandatory.
CB02760 | Laboratory Methods for Computational Biologists | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=02760&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Naik, Armaghan Ayoob, Joseph description:Computational biologists frequently focus on analyzing and modeling large amounts of biological data, often from high-throughput assays or diverse sources. It is therefore critical that students training in computational biology be familiar with the paradigms and methods of experimentation and measurement that lead to the production of these data. This one-semester laboratory course gives students a deeper appreciation of the principles and challenges of biological experimentation. Students learn a range of topics, including experimental design, structural biology, next generation sequencing, genomics, proteomics, bioimaging, and high-content screening. Class sessions are primarily devoted to designing and performing experiments in the lab using the above techniques. Students are required to keep a detailed laboratory notebook of their experiments and summarize their resulting data in written abstracts and oral presentations given in class-hosted lab meetings. With an emphasis on the basics of experimentation and broad views of multiple cutting-edge and high-throughput techniques, this course is appropriate for students who have never taken a traditional undergraduate biology lab course, as well as those who have and are looking for introductory training in more advanced approaches. Grading: Letter grade based on class participation, laboratory notebooks, experimental design assignments, and written and oral presentations.
