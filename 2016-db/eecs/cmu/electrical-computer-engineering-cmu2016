It solidifies the theoretical background and practical skills gained in 18320 and 18422.    The primary stress of the class will be on the IC design process as a whole. Such a process, seen as a sequence of design decisions, must lead to a design which optimizes a given objective function under a number of constraints. The optimum design must be achieved using a number of variables involving all levels of design abstraction and ranging between architecture choice and detail of the IC layout.     Typical design objectives adopted in class designs will be IC performance (throughput, power, signal-to-noise ratio, clock frequency, gain-bandwidth, etc.) and typical constraints will be die size and minimum feature size.    The second most important objective of the class is to mimic a large design team environment in which individual designers must: (a) communicate precisely and efficiently his/her ideas and (b) utilize any feedback provided by the "design environment." This objective will be achieved through class presentations given by each student and by stressing the importance of design documentation.

Of particular interest are systematic model-based methods for relating the key real-life problems for such systems and the state-of-the-art techniques for large-scale dynamic systems. Examples of such real-life complex systems are critical man-made infrastructure systems (electric power systems, gas networks, transport industries, data networks, and their interdependencies) as well as large-scale systems on chips.   In this course we will first review the traditional large-scale methods for model simplification (aggregation), time scale separation of sub-processes and singular perturbation techniques to account for these, stability analysis, and estimation and control. In the second, novel part of this course, we recognize the highly interactive nature of the evolving complex systems, in which much monitoring, data gathering, and decision making is made at the lower, physical levels of the system, and some coordination exists at the higher system level at which physical layers interact. Several conceptual challenges are posed for minimal coordination of such decision makers under high uncertainties, in order to have predictable performance. These concepts will be illustrated using the same man-made network systems of interest introduced at the beginning of the course.

This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.

ECE18842 | Distributed Systems | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=18842&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Nace, William prereq:(15605 or 18342 or 18348 or 18349) and (18345 or 18756 or 14740 or 15641) description:Many of today's computing systems are designed and constructed for execution on many different hosts connected via standard networks and protocols.  This course examines the fundamental principles that are vital to the construction of such systems:  models of distributed systems, synchronization, mutual exclusion, naming, group communication, transactions, cryptography, security and distributed algorithms.  We will then examine higher level abstractions such as distributed filesystems, process scheduling and peer-to-peer overlay networks.  An intensive hands-on semester-long group project will be carried out to complement the concepts taught in the course. Please Note:  Introduction to Computer Systems: 18-213/15-213 or 15-513 is a required pre-requisite for this course
ECE18843 | Mobile and Pervasive Computing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=18843&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Zhang, Pei prereq:15410 description:This is a course exploring research issues in the newly emerging field of mobile computing. Many traditional areas of computer science and computer engineering are impacted by the constraints and demands of mobility. Examples include network protocols, power management, user interfaces, file access, ergonomics, and security. This will be an "advanced" course in the truest sense --- most, if not all, the topics discussed will be ones where there is little consensus in the research community on the best approaches. The course will also offer significant "hand-on" experience in this area. Each student will have to present and lead the discussion on a number of papers. Students will work in groups of three under the guidance of a mentor on a hands-on project. Each student will also be required to write one of two documents: (a) a research proposal (similar in spirit to an NSF proposal) on an idea in mobile computing or (b) a short business plan for a commercial opportunity in mobile computing. Grading will be based on the quality of the presentations, the project, and the proposal or business plan.     Prerequisites: 15-410 and senior or graduate standing.

ECE18875 | Engineering and Economics of Electric Energy Systems | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=18875&SEMESTER=S16 | instructors:Ilic, Jovan description:The course has two parts. The first part introduces basic components and networks used in the electric power industry. This is followed by systematic modeling of these components, as well as of the entire system. Methods for modeling and analyzing both system equilibria and dynamics are presented. Simulations and lab demos are given to simulate and analyze typical system blackouts. This is followed by introducing decision and control methods for preventing these problems, as well as for managing the system more reliably, securely and efficiently over broad ranges of its operating conditions. The emphasis is on IT, software and control (both distributed and coordination) for achieving pre-specified system performance. This part of the course will involve simulation demos and hands on studies in which students create their own power network, simulate it and assess for performance. The second part of the course will review the industry structure, the experience with deregulatio n, and economic issues concerning choice of generating fuel and technology, the costs of blackouts, and environmental discharges. The course will integrate engineering and economic aspects to examine the design, investment, and operations that satisfy public desires for low cost, nonpolluting, reliable, and secure power. Knowledge of basic electric circuits and/or basic economics is assumed.      3 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec.    Prerequisites: Basic electric circuits and/or basic economics and at least graduate standing.
