Should we allow them to select a target and launch weapons? To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around?  Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go?  Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons?  Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe?  As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used.  This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us.  We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates.  Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking.  The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments.

However, our energy usage is rising at an alarming rate and therefore it has become critical to manage its consumption more efficiently for long term sustainability. This course introduces students to the exciting area of "Green Computing", and is organizationally divided into two tracks. The first track is "Energy-Efficient Computing", which considers the state of the art techniques for improving the energy efficiency of mobile devices, to laptop and desktop class computers and finally to data centers. We will cover energy efficiency across the hardware/software stack, starting from the individual components like processors and radio interfaces to system level architectures and optimizations. The second track is "Applying Computing towards Sustainability", covering topics that leverage computing to reduce the energy footprint of our society. In particular, we will focus on Smart Buildings and the Smart Grid, covering topics such as sensing, modeling and controlling the energy usage of buildings, new operating systems or software stacks for the smart infrastructure, as well as the privacy and security issues with the new "internet of things". The goal of this course is to help students acquire some of the knowledge and the skills needed to do research in this space of "Green Computing".  Although the course is listed within SCS, it should be of interest to students in several departments, including ECE, MechE, CEE, EPP and Architecture.

In this course we will take a hand on approach towards building hardware and software systems within the context of these emerging smart homes and smart building domains. You will learn about embedded systems and how to choose the appropriate one for different smart home projects, including understanding the advantages and limitations of such platforms. You will learn about sensors and how to interface them with the real world to be able to get useful and actionable data. You will learn about designing systems from ground up, including schematic and PCB layouts. You will learn about different radio technologies, so that you can build a network of sensors that can communicate with each other. You will also learn about storing the sensor data for visualization, analysis and presentation both locally and to the cloud. The course will comprise of hands on exercises, which build upon each other as the course progresses through the semester. We will likely use an embedded platform such as the Rasberry PI or the BeagleBone Black (cost between $75 and $100) and each student will be expected to buy one of these platforms to use throughout the semester. From time to time we will also discuss latest research papers and case studies on topics related to smart home and buildings, with the focus towards deployed systems. The course grade will be computed based on the homework and mini-project assignments, class presentations and a semester long course project. It is expected that students will have some programming background, are excited to take on hands on projects, and want to learn how to build end to end systems for smart homes. As a side effect, perhaps some of your ideas will lead to the next NEST (sold for $3.2B in 2014!).

This course introduces students to the exciting area of "Green Computing", and is organizationally divided into two tracks. The first track is "Energy-Efficient Computing", which considers the state of the art techniques for improving the energy efficiency of mobile devices, to laptop and desktop class computers and finally to data centers. We will cover energy efficiency across the hardware/software stack, starting from the individual components like processors and radio interfaces to system level architectures and optimizations. The second track is "Applying Computing towards Sustainability", covering topics that leverage computing to reduce the energy footprint of our society. In particular, we will focus on Smart Buildings and the Smart Grid, covering topics such as sensing, modeling and controlling the energy usage of buildings, new operating systems or software stacks for the smart infrastructure, as well as the privacy and security issues with the new "internet of things". The goal of this course is to help students acquire some of the knowledge and the skills needed to do research in this space of "Green Computing".  Although the course is listed within SCS, it should be of interest to students in several departments, including ECE, MechE, CEE, EPP and Architecture.
ISR08841 | Hardware and Software Systems for Smart Homes and Buildings: Hardware and Software Systems for Smart Homes and BuildingsThis Section Cancelled | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=08841&SEMESTER=F15 | instructors:Agarwal, Yuvraj description:Smart automation in the home and buildings hold tremendous promise to enhance the quality of our lives and improving energy efficiency. In this course we will take a hand on approach towards building hardware and software systems within the context of these emerging smart homes and smart building domains. You will learn about embedded systems and how to choose the appropriate one for different smart home projects, including understanding the advantages and limitations of such platforms. You will learn about sensors and how to interface them with the real world to be able to get useful and actionable data. You will learn about designing systems from ground up, including schematic and PCB layouts. You will learn about different radio technologies, so that you can build a network of sensors that can communicate with each other. You will also learn about storing the sensor data for visualization, analysis and presentation both locally and to the cloud. The course will comprise of hands on exercises, which build upon each other as the course progresses through the semester. We will likely use an embedded platform such as the Rasberry PI or the BeagleBone Black (cost between $35 and $50) and each student will be expected to buy one of these platforms to use throughout the semester. From time to time we will also discuss latest research papers and case studies on topics related to smart home and buildings, with the focus towards deployed systems. The course grade will be computed based on the homework and mini-project assignments, class presentations and a semester long course project. It is expected that students will have some programming background, are excited to take on hands on projects, and want to learn how to build end to end systems for smart homes. As a side effect, perhaps some of your ideas will lead to the next NEST (sold for $3.2B in 2014!).
