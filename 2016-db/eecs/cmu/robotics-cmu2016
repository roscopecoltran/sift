ROB16223 | Introduction to Physical Computing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16223&SEMESTER=F15 | instructors:Zeglin, Garth description:Physical computing refers to the design and construction of physical systems that use a mix of software and hardware to sense and respond to the surrounding world.  Such systems blend digital and physical processes into toys and gadgets, kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments, interactive wearables, and more.  This is a project-based course that deals with all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities.  The course is organized around a series of practical hands-on exercises which introduce the fundamentals of circuits, embedded programming, sensor signal processing, simple mechanisms, actuation, and time-based behavior.  The key objective is gaining an intuitive understanding of how information and energy move between the physical, electronic, and computational domains to create a desired behavior.  The exercises provide building blocks for collaborative projects which utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider how to make things, but also for whom we design, and why the making is worthwhile.This course is an IDeATe Portal Course for entry into either of the IDeATe Intelligent Environments or Physical Computing programs. CFA/DC/TPR students can enroll under 16-223; CIT/MCS/SCS students can enroll in the 60-223 version of the course.  Please note that there will be lab usage and materials fees associated with this course.

We will work in small groups with small robots that are controlled over wireless from your laptop computers. The robots are Neato household vacuum robots that have been converted to mini forktrucks that can move pallets from place to place just like commercial automated guided vehicles do today. The robots are programmed in the modern MATLAB programming environment. It is a pretty easy language to learn, and a very powerful one for prototyping robotics algorithms.   You will get a lot of experience in this course in addition to some theory. Lectures are focused on the content of the next lab. There is a lab every week and they build on each other so that a complete robot software system results. The course will culminate with a class-wide robot competition that tests the performance of all of your code implemented in the semester. In order to succeed in the course, students must have a 2nd year science/engineering level background in mathematics (matrices, vectors, coordinate systems) and have already mastered at least one procedural programming language like C or Java. When the course is over, you will have written a single software system that has been incrementally extended in functionality and regularly debugged throughout the semester.

EPCS is a structured and mentored classroom, laboratory, and industry experience wherein students learn project identification, design, execution, analysis, and presentation methods via doing an applied robotics or closely related hands-on project. This in-context real-world experience is designed to give MS-RT graduates the competitive edge they will need when, in their future entrepreneurial careers, they are called upon to reduce basic academic innovations to applied practical realizations as systems and products, and to present their ideas and results in a variety of media and styles tailored to clearly identified targeted audiences.The EPCS is thus the element of the MS-RT program that most sets it apart from traditional academic masters programs.  During MS-RT Year-One the initial two semesters of the EPCS are completed at CMU's Partner Institution's campus.  During MS-RT Year-Two, the final two semesters of the ECPS are completed at CMU's Pittsburgh campus.  During the semester between Year-One and Year-Two the MS-RT student completes the data collection phase of his or her ECPS while in residence at a practicum location, generally industrial, but potentially a university research laboratory.The structure of the Extended Project Course Sequence is:Year-One - Semester-One: Research Methods ("prepare")Year-One - Semester-Two: Project Identification and Specification ("plan")Summer: Project Data Collection (on-site at a practicum location) ("execute")Year-Two - Semester-One: Data Analysis & Drawing Conclusions ("analyse")Year-Two - Semester-Two: Presenting Conclusions to Different Audiences ("present")

Students will be taught the project / technology development process all the way from developing performance-requirements/system-specifications through the technology development cycle, all the way to test-plan development and results analysis and reporting. The outcome of this two-semester course will be a final project report, coupled with a demonstration and group presentation.  The goal of the MRSD Project Course is to provide practical experience in robotic system development ranging from specification and design to implementation and testing. Projects will be defined jointly with industrial clients, and small student teams will work with these client companies in implementing, refining, and presenting the results of their projects. The course will provide opportunities to apply principles from other MRSD courses, especially the Systems Engineering course, as well as those from the Business Seminar series. Class lectures will emphasize practical application and cover relevant topics including robotic design methodologies, system modeling, mechanical components, sensor and I/O interfacing, motor control, microcontroller and embedded control basics, basic software development methodologies, and troubleshooting.
ROB16697 | Introduction to Robotics Business | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16697&SEMESTER=F15 | instructors:Bourne, David description:(For MRSD students only.) Students will be required to participate in a two-semester on-campus seminar-style lecture and team-project class. These two mini-courses will cover technical, business, management, finance, production, marketing & sales and writing/presentation topics at a broad yet deep enough level, to allow students to participate in individual teams towards the creation of a Technology Development Plan (TDP; akin to a Business Plan with less emphasis on detailed monthly cash-flow). Speakers from academia (technical, business) and industry (production, case-studies, etc.) will cover a myriad number of topics to provide students the foundation to be able to compose a TDP. The Technology Plan is expected to cover all aspects required by a company to define a new product development: analyze the competition and market opportunity, detail the envisioned product, lay out the development path and its required resources (personnel, facilities, hardware, etc.), plan out (time, resources & cost) the production-readiness activities, develop costing and pricing models and develop a marketing and sales plan for the product introduction. All these elements will form part of the TDP, which will be submitted as a final report and orally presented by the team to the class / faculty at the conclusion of the two-semester course.    The course will be taught using a weekly lecture series. The format of the lectures will be based on the coverage of key topics of importance to understanding the connections between technology (design, development, etc.), management (leadership, teaming, negotiations, etc.) and business (finance, etc.), marketing/sales, intellectual property protection and manufacturing and pricing. Students will be expected to form development teams and have out-of-class team-meetings to self-organize themselves and work on their joint TDP.

ROB16831 | Statistical Techniques in Robotics | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16831&SEMESTER=F15 | instructors:Kitani, Kris Kaess, Michael description:Probabilistic and learning techniques are now an essential part of  building robots (or embedded systems) designed to operate in the real  world. These systems must deal with uncertainty and adapt to changes  in the environment by learning from experience. Uncertainty arises  from many sources: the inherent limitations in our ability to model  the world, noise and perceptual limitations in sensor measurements,  and the approximate nature of algorithmic solutions. Building  intelligent machines also requires that they adapt to their  environment. Few things are more frustrating than machines that  repeat the same mistake over and over again. We'll explore modern  learning techniques that are effective at learning online: i.e.  throughout the robots operation. We'll explore how the twin ideas of  uncertainty and adaptation are closely tied in both theory and  implementation.
