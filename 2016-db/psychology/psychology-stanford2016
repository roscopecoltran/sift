PSYCH10N | Kids, Culture, and Poverty:  From Biology to Social Action | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PSYCH10N | instructors:Fernald, A. (PI) description:Years before they set foot in school, children growing up in poor families begin to diverge from children in richer families in their trajectories of cognitive and language growth.  These differences have powerful and enduring consequences for the health, well-being, educational success, and longevity of individuals,  as well as for the future prosperity of the societies in which children become adults.  Early childhood is a time of both enormous promise and considerable risk, and parents in different cultures have widely differing practices and beliefs about their role in enabling children to avoid risk and achieve their potential.  In this seminar we will evaluate evidence from the biological and social sciences showing how positive and negative experiences in infancy have profound and enduring effects on early brain architecture, with cascading consequences for later development in childhood and adulthood.  We will also consider the challenges of designing more effective programs and social policies to provide support for families in diverse cultural contexts, with the goal of helping more children to reach their full potential.

PSYCH132A | Navigating Race and Identity in America: The Role of Psychology in Racial Interactions (CSRE 118F) | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PSYCH132A | instructors:Manke, K. (PI) description:How have social institutions and historical factors led to the belief systems and stereotypes that shape how race is experienced in American society, and how do these belief systems affect the way individuals within racial groups come to view and define themselves?nThis course will serve as an introduction to how people¿s psychology¿how they think, feel, and act¿shapes their experience of race and identity in America. After a brief discussion about the structural and systemic origins of the racial status quo, we will examine the way that individuals navigate the social and racial landscape of modern-day America. Complementing courses that take sociological approaches to race in America, this course will focus on how individuals¿ perceptions and thoughts about the world affect how they interpret and respond to social situations.nFor example, the course will address:n¿nhow stereotypes about one¿s race or identity can cause individuals to feel threatened, and can undermine health, feelings of belonging, and academic performance n¿nhow an individual¿s concerns about the thoughts and beliefs of others can radically affect identity formation, particularly during adolescencen¿nhow individuals have to navigate multiple cultural identities, especially as minority group members contending with mainstream ideas that differ from their ownn¿nhow majority group members (e.g., Whites) view their role in racial systems, and how they deal with concerns about being or appearing prejudiced  n¿nhow interventions can use social psychological concepts to mitigate negative outcomes of racial inequalitynWe will then use our understanding of these concepts to examine and consider different racial situations thoughout American society and to understand how individuals navigate and experience race and identity. Throughout the course, we will watch films, read literature, and analyze music and art that reflect the experience of race and identity.

PSYCH175 | Early Learning and Social Cognition | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PSYCH175 | instructors:Gweon, H. (PI); Weisman, K. (TA) description:Social cognition, the ability to perceive others, understand their behaviors, and reason about their thoughts, is a critical component of what makes us human. In what ways does this ability help young children learn about the world, and what can science tell us about the representations and the inferential processes that underlie early learning? This course will explore various topics on social cognition with an emphasis on (but not limited to) developmental perspectives, including face perception, action understanding, and Theory of Mind, and encourage students to think about how these abilities might be linked to the developmental changes in children's understanding of the world. Another goal of the course is to offer an insight into the fundamental questions that have motivated psychological research on social cognition, and the value of developmental methods in addressing these questions.

PSYCH178 | New Methods for Old Questions: Linking Social Cognition and Social Cognitive Neuroscience | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PSYCH178 | instructors:Gweon, H. (PI) description:Novel technology can fuel new discoveries and generate new questions for future research. For instance, looking-time methods for studying infants or response time (RT) measures in cognitive psychology have been enabled by the use of computers and video cameras. More recently, neuroimaging techniques (such as fMRI) have transformed the field by offering a more direct look into the working human brain. These methods are, in a way, ¿old¿ and ¿new¿ ways of studying what psychologists want to study ¿ mental representations. nnWhat are the promises and challenges of using these methods to study human cognition and its development? What have we learned, where have we fallen short, and why? Most importantly, how can we make the most out of these new methods to bear on our understanding of social cognition and its development?  After the first two weeks of lectures on basic methods, each week we will consider a topic that has been extensively studied in cognitive development literature. Topics will include: perception of agency, theory of mind, and morality; on each topic, we will compare two different ways of studying mental representations ¿ the ¿old¿ way (behavior) and the ¿new¿ way (neural response) ¿ to assess their relative benefits and shortcomings, and to discuss the promises and pitfalls for combining the two.nnThis course will be a combination of lectures, presentations, and discussions aimed primarily for upper-class undergraduate students or graduate students who do not have much background in neuroimaging methods, but interested in learning more about neuroimaging methods and think about how these methods can (and cannot) help address questions about social cognition and development.

Over the course of the semester, students will be challenged to think critically about research from psychology, sociology, and medicine, which suggests that what we think, believe and expect plays a significant role in determining our physical health, performance and well-being. Students will explore research on how mindsets about nutrition, exercise, and stress can alter the body¿s response to those phenomena.  Students will also uncover how social interactions with friends, family, colleagues and the media influence the perceived quality and impact of cultural products such as art, music, and fashion.  And students will learn about the neurological and physiological underpinnings of the placebo effect, a powerful demonstration of expectation that produces real, healing changes in the body.  Finally, students will have the opportunity to consider real world applications in disciplines including policy, business, medicine, academics, athletics and public health and consider the ethical implications of those applications.  Throughout the class active participation and an open mind will be critical to success. The final weeks of class will be dedicated to student designed studies or interventions aimed to further explore the power of self-fulfilling prophecies, placebo effects, and the social-psychological creation of reality.

Recent psychological advances in our understanding of the cognitive and social origins of morality cast a new light on age-old questions about ethics, such as: How did our moral sense evolve in our species? How does it develop over our lifetime? How much does our culture, religion, or politics determine our moral values? What is the role of intuition and emotion in moral judgment? How "logical" is moral judgment? How do other people's moral choices affect us? Does character matter or is behavior entirely dictated by the situations we find ourselves in? If it is purely situational, are we morally responsible for anything? How far will we go to convince ourselves that we are good and moral? Barbara Fried and Benoit Monin will review empirical answers to these questions suggested by behavioral research, and lead discussions on their implications for ethics.  Students enrolled in the course will be selected through an application process.

PSYCH9N | Reading the Brain: the Scientific, Ethical, and Legal Implications of Brain Imaging | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PSYCH9N | instructors:Poldrack, R. (PI) description:It's hard to pick up a newspaper without seeing a story that involves brain imaging, from research on psychological disorders to its use for lie detection or "neuromarketing". The methods are indeed very powerful, but many of the claims seen in the press are results of overly strong interpretations. In this course, you will learn to evaluate claims based on brain imaging research. We will also explore the deeper ethical and philosophical issues that arise from our ability to peer into our own brains in action. The course will start by discussing how to understand and interpret the findings of brain imaging research. We will discuss how new statistical methods provide the ability to accurately predict thoughts and behaviors from brain images. We will explore how this research has the potential to change our concepts of the self, personal responsibility and free will. We will also discuss the ethics of brain imaging, such as how the ability to detect thoughts relates to personal privacy and mental illness. Finally, we will discuss the legal implications of these techniques, such as their use in lie detection or as evidence against legal culpability.
