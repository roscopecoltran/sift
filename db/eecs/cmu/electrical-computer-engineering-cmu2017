It solidifies the theoretical background and practical skills gained in 18320 and 18422.    The primary stress of the class will be on the IC design process as a whole. Such a process, seen as a sequence of design decisions, must lead to a design which optimizes a given objective function under a number of constraints. The optimum design must be achieved using a number of variables involving all levels of design abstraction and ranging between architecture choice and detail of the IC layout.     Typical design objectives adopted in class designs will be IC performance (throughput, power, signal-to-noise ratio, clock frequency, gain-bandwidth, etc.) and typical constraints will be die size and minimum feature size.    The second most important objective of the class is to mimic a large design team environment in which individual designers must: (a) communicate precisely and efficiently his/her ideas and (b) utilize any feedback provided by the design environment. This objective will be achieved through class presentations given by each student and by stressing the importance of design documentation.

Unfortunately, device scaling has hit a limit   on performance and power improvements dictated by physical device properties. To continue to make systems capable, fast, energy efficient, programmable, and reliable in this post-Dennard era, computer architects must be creative and innovate across the layers of the system stack.  This course begins with a recap of conventional, sequential computer architecture concepts.  We will then discuss the end of convention, brought about by the end of Dennard Scaling and Moores Law, and several trends that these changes precipitated.  The first trend is the wholesale shift to parallel computer architectures and systems, covering parallel hardware and software execution models, cache coherence, memory consistency, synchronization, transactional memory, and architecture support for programming, debugging, and failure avoidance.  The second trend is the shift to incorporating specialized, heterogeneous components into parallel computer architectures.  Topics will include reconfigurable architectures, FPGAs in the datacenter, ASIC accelerators, GPGPU architectures, and the changes to the system stack that these components demand. The third trend is the emergence of newly capable hardware and software systems and new models of computation.  Topics will include approximate and neuromorphic computing, intermittent computing, emerging non-volatile memory and logic technologies, and analog and asynchronous architectures, and may include future emerging topics.

ECE18747 | Wireless Device Architecture | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=18747&SEMESTER=F16 | instructors:Iannucci, Robert description:Growth of the Internet of Things depends on semiconductor devices  systems-on-chip (SoC)  with significant computational, communications and sensing capabilities.  Integration of entire systems on one or a very small number of dies has made it possible to deploy hundreds of billions of end-points that will link the cyber world with the physical world.  At this scale, a key design requirement is that such devices can be handled at most once during their lifetime.  Batteries should be life-long, and reprogramming should be over-the-air.  How then should such devices be architected?  We begin by examining modern digital communications including modulation and coding schemes, basic RF subsystems and antennas.  We examine the computational structures that allow us to reduce communication to computation.  Anticipating that such devices will need to be highly programmable, we consider concepts from traditional computer architecture and their applicability to this energy-constrained domain. We also examine the rapid evolution of transducer technologies and how these are being integrated into SoCs.  Then, we consider how an architect can make tradeoffs across these domains to meet design objectives.  Students will take advantage of a purpose-built experimental platform called PowerDu that enables deep exploration of these topics in realistic applications. Background in computer architecture, signals and systems, and EM field theory is recommended.  Graduate standing is required to register for this course.

This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.
