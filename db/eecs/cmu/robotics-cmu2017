ROB16223 | Introduction to Physical Computing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=16223&SEMESTER=F16 | instructors:Zeglin, Garth description:Physical computing refers to the design and construction of physical systems that use a mix of software and hardware to sense and respond to the surrounding world.  Such systems blend digital and physical processes into toys and gadgets, kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments, interactive wearables, and more.  This is a project-based course that deals with all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities.  The course is organized around a series of practical hands-on exercises which introduce the fundamentals of circuits, embedded programming, sensor signal processing, simple mechanisms, actuation, and time-based behavior.  The key objective is gaining an intuitive understanding of how information and energy move between the physical, electronic, and computational domains to create a desired behavior.  The exercises provide building blocks for collaborative projects which utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider how to make things, but also for whom we design, and why the making is worthwhile.  This course is an IDeATe Portal Course for entry into either of the IDeATe Intelligent Environments or Physical Computing programs.  CFA/DC/TPR students can enroll under 16-223; CIT/MCS/SCS students can enroll in the 60-223 version of the course.  Please note that there will be lab usage and materials fees associated with this course.

We will work in small groups with small robots that are controlled over wireless from your laptop computers. The robots are Neato household vacuum robots that have been converted to mini forktrucks that can move pallets from place to place just like commercial automated guided vehicles do today. The robots are programmed in the modern MATLAB programming environment. It is a pretty easy language to learn, and a very powerful one for prototyping robotics algorithms.   You will get a lot of experience in this course in addition to some theory. Lectures are focused on the content of the next lab. There is a lab every week and they build on each other so that a complete robot software system results. The course will culminate with a class-wide robot competition that tests the performance of all of your code implemented in the semester. In order to succeed in the course, students must have a 2nd year science/engineering level background in mathematics (matrices, vectors, coordinate systems) and have already mastered at least one procedural programming language like C or Java. When the course is over, you will have written a single software system that has been incrementally extended in functionality and regularly debugged throughout the semester.

There are three major reviews approximately at the end of each of the first three months of the semester.  For each review, the students give a presentation and submit an updated version of the System Design and Development Document. The course culminates in a System Performance Validation Demonstration at the end of the semester. In addition to that the students hold a special demonstration of their robotic system for the broader Robotics community.

Special permission is determined on a case by case basis.  Please contact the MS-RT director.   Extended Project Course Sequence (EPCS): The EPCS is a thread that runs through the MS-RTs two semesters during Year-One at a partner institution, two semesters during Year-Two on the CMU-Pittsburgh campus, and the summer between the two academic years. It is a research experience intended to prepare international professional masters degree students in robotics for future entrepreneurial careers in their home countries. Its aim is less to require that they personally augment humanitys knowledge base, as would be required in an academic/research degree program, and more to teach them how to evaluate others research for its entrepreneurial potential, and to learn the process for transitioning it from a university lab to a position of economic value and social benefit. The five course modules of the sequence are identified as prepare, plan, execute, analyze, and present. Prepare  means to develop a high-level understanding of the research-with-a-goal architecting process. Plan means to identify, propose, and schedule the intended course of a specific project. Execute means to obtain data, preferably with an industrial sponsor identified in the plan  segment, but potentially alternatively in a university research lab.  Analyze means to draw defensible conclusions from the data, and accordingly to plan a commercialization route. Present is the professional programs alternative to a research thesis: students present their conclusions and future plans in several different formats each targeting a different clearly identified dissemination medium and audience interest, for example, written and orally presented versions of a professional magazine article, a trade show poster presentation, an engineering teams technical report, and a pitch to a venture capital source.

We help to identify an opportunity for a robotics business and explore the business fundamentals of how to build and manage it.  The first step is to develop an appropriate innovative idea that can find a profitable home in the marketplace.  To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the prevalent trends of the current economic environment and how to market and position your product.  Here we utilize experts in marketing and innovation management.  The product may be a consumer product, or an improvement process  for some aspect of a business cycle (e.g., manufacturing or service).  However, we expect that the selected invention will be a new type of robot, a robotic application or part of an ever expanding robotic-ecosystem.  Please note that we have a very expansive view of what can count as a robot  Once a project area is selected we introduce the financial basics that are necessary to fund and sustain a new product initiative.  In the end, the product idea must be sold to either venture capitalists, private funding agents, corporate funding agents or government agencies.  The course is a project based and is executed by a team of you and your fellow students.  The final report can either be a business plan or a proposal for funding from an agency such as NSF (Small Business Innovation Research).  Professor Bourne has taught robotics to CMU business students since 1988.  Now for the first time he is teaching business to robotics students along with a handful of top CMU Tepper School Business Faculty.

These systems must deal with uncertainty and adapt to changes in the environment by learning from experience. Uncertainty arises from many sources: the inherent limitations in our ability to model the world, noise and perceptual limitations in sensor measurements, and the approximate nature of algorithmic solutions. Building intelligent machines also requires that they adapt to their environment. Few things are more frustrating than machines that repeat the same mistake over and over again. Well explore (1) modern learning techniques that are effective at learning online: i.e. throughout the robots operation, and (2) efficient probabilistic inference algorithms in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping
