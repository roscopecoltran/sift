Hold scripts used by Nodepool to prepare an instance


setup_node.sh

The reference image created by DIB is booted and setup_node.sh is run to
complete the base setup.  That is run once a day or automatically by Nodepool.
It is a good place to refresh git mirrors, rerun puppet and do apt-get
update/upgrade.

Once completed, Nodepool asks OpenStack to snapshot the instance. It will then
boot instance out of it.

The script is run as the `debian` user which has sudo access.


ready.sh

Used to update the snapshoted instance (see above).  Last minutes changes that
we want to complete before an instance is added to Jenkins node.

Can be used for sanity check such as ensuring DNS works or quickly updating a
setting file.


The scripts need to be manually deployed on the Nodepool server
(labnodepool1001.eqiad.wmnet) by git pulling in /etc/nodepool/wikimedia.
